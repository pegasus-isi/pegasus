Check pegasus-exitcode.

This program parses job outputs looking for failures. If failures are found,
it prints a message and exits with a non-zero exit code. If no failures are
found, it exits with 0.

This program also renames the .out and .err file to .out.XXX and .err.XXX
where XXX is a sequence number. This sequence number is incremented each time
the program is run with the same filename.out argument.
