#
# Workflow summary:
#   Summary of the workflow execution. It shows total
#   tasks/jobs/sub workflows run, how many succeeded/failed etc.
#   In case of hierarchical workflow the calculation shows the
#   statistics across all the sub workflows.It shows the following
#   statistics about tasks, jobs and sub workflows.
#     * Succeeded - total count of succeeded tasks/jobs/sub workflows.
#     * Failed - total count of failed tasks/jobs/sub workflows.
#     * Incomplete - total count of tasks/jobs/sub workflows that are
#       not in succeeded or failed state. This includes all the jobs
#       that are not submitted, submitted but not completed etc. This
#       is calculated as  difference between 'total' count and sum of
#       'succeeded' and 'failed' count.
#     * Total - total count of tasks/jobs/sub workflows.
#     * Retries - total retry count of tasks/jobs/sub workflows.
#     * Total+Retries - total count of tasks/jobs/sub workflows executed
#       during workflow run. This is the cumulative of retries,
#       succeeded and failed count.
# Workflow wall time:
#   The wall time from the start of the workflow execution to the end as
#   reported by the DAGMAN.In case of rescue dag the value is the
#   cumulative of all retries.
# Cumulative job wall time:
#   The sum of the wall time of all jobs as reported by kickstart.
#   In case of job retries the value is the cumulative of all retries.
#   For workflows having sub workflow jobs (i.e SUBDAG and SUBDAX jobs),
#   the wall time value includes jobs from the sub workflows as well.
# Cumulative job wall time as seen from submit side:
#   The sum of the wall time of all jobs as reported by DAGMan.
#   This is similar to the regular cumulative job wall time, but includes
#   job management overhead and delays. In case of job retries the value
#   is the cumulative of all retries. For workflows having sub workflow
#   jobs (i.e SUBDAG and SUBDAX jobs), the wall time value includes jobs
#   from the sub workflows as well.
# Cumulative job badput wall time:
#   The sum of the wall time of all failed jobs as reported by kickstart.
#   In case of job retries the value is the cumulative of all retries.
#   For workflows having sub workflow jobs (i.e SUBDAG and SUBDAX jobs),
#   the wall time value includes jobs from the sub workflows as well.
# Cumulative job badput wall time as seen from submit side:
#   The sum of the wall time of all failed jobs as reported by DAGMan.
#   This is similar to the regular cumulative job badput wall time, but includes
#   job management overhead and delays. In case of job retries the value
#   is the cumulative of all retries. For workflows having sub workflow
#   jobs (i.e SUBDAG and SUBDAX jobs), the wall time value includes jobs
#   from the sub workflows as well.
