NOTE: Do not copy and paste the commands below without double checking.
      The commands contain version numbers which are probably not
      correct for what you are trying to do!


1.  Clone and move to the specific branch. For example:

       git clone https://github.com/pegasus-isi/pegasus.git
       cd pegasus
       git checkout N.M

2.  Set the version number in build.properties and commit:

       vim build.properties
       git commit -a -m "Setting version for tag"

3.  Tag. Example:

        git tag -a -m "Created tag for N.M.O" N.M.O

4.  Open branch for new checkins with new version:

       vim build.properties
       git commit -a -m "Branch reopen for checkins"

5.  Bring the branch back to master, but ignore the commits.

       git checkout master
       git merge --no-commit N.M
    (edit build.properties)
       git commit -a -m "Merged N.M"

6.  git push --tags

7.  Build with Bamboo

8.  Build APT repo. First copy the debs into their final place in
    the apt trees (Debian and Ubuntu). Then run
    update-pegasus-apt-repo on a Debian machine. Do this on
    download.pegasus.isi.edu (/opt/release-tools)

9.  Build Yum repo. Similar to Apt repo, but the step has to be
    done on a RHEL machine. Do this on workflow.

10. Publish Python packages to PypI

```bash
# Install Twine (Once)
pip install twine

# Create .pypirc (Once)
$ cat ~/.pypirc
[distutils]
  index-servers=
    pypi
    test-pypi

[pypi]
  username: <pypi-username>
  password: <pypi-password>

# WARNING: PyPi only allows uploading of files for a version once.
$ twine upload <python-package>
```

11. Update Homebrew formula in repo https://github.com/pegasus-isi/homebrew-tools.git.

12. Build deplot Docker tutorial.

```bash
ssh admin@pegasus-tutorial.isi.edu "cd /lfs1/pegasus-docker-tutorial ; ./build.sh"
```

13. Create and deploy the tutorial VMs.

14. Change the symbolic link for the latest documentation to point
    to latest stable release
    https://pegasus.isi.edu/documentation/

15. Send annouce email to pegasus-announce@mailman.isi.edu
    (Karan has to do this step)
