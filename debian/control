Description: Workflow management system for Condor, Grid, and Clouds
 The Pegasus project encompasses a set of technologies the help
 workflow-based applications execute in a number of different
 environments including desktops, campus clusters, grids, and now
 clouds. Scientific workflows allow users to easily express
 multi-step computations, for example retrieve data from a
 database, reformat the data, and run an analysis. Once an
 application is formalized as a workflow the Pegasus Workflow
 Management Service can map it onto available compute resources
 and execute the steps in appropriate order.
