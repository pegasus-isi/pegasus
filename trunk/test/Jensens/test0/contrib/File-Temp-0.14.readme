File::Temp - provides functions for generating temporary files

This is release V0.14 of File::Temp. This module can be used to
generate temporary files (providing a filename and filehandle) or directories.
Possible race conditions are avoided and some security checks are performed
(eg making sure the sticky bit is set on world writeable temp directories).

It could be considered to be in a late beta state since it has only been
tested on six operating systems. The Windows implementation is not
yet at release quality since currently files are only deleted when
the program exits (via an END block), this differs from the Unix
implementation where files can be deleted when the file is closed.
The object-oriented implementation can get around this problem
by making use of the object destructor to delete the file.

Please let me know if it fails on other operating systems.

TEST FAILURES

Test failures from lib/security saying "system possibly insecure"

Firstly, test failures from the ftmp-security are not necessarily
serious or indicative of a real security threat.  That being said,
they bear investigating.

The tests may fail for the following reasons.   Note that each of the
tests is run both in the building directory and the temporary
directory, as returned by File::Spec->tmpdir().

(1) If the directory the tests are being run is owned by somebody else
than the user running the tests, or root (uid 0).  This failure can
happen if the Perl source code distribution is unpacked in a way that
the user ids in the distribution package are used as-is.  Some tar
programs do this.

(2) If the directory the test are being run in is writable by group
or by other (remember: with UNIX/POSIX semantics, write access to
a directory means the right to add/remove files in that directory),
and there is no sticky bit set in the directory.  'Sticky bit' is
a feature used in some UNIXes to give extra protection to files: if
the bit is on a directory, no one but the owner (or the root) can remove
that file even if the permissions of the directory would allow file
removal by others.  This failure can happen if the permissions in the
directory simply are a bit too liberal for the tests' liking.  This
may or may not be a real problem: it depends on the permissions policy
used on this particular directory/project/system/site.  This failure
can also happen if the system either doesn't support the sticky bit
(this is the case with many non-UNIX platforms: in principle the
File::Temp should know about these platforms and skip the tests), or
if the system supports the sticky bit but for some reason or reasons
it is not being used.  This is for example the case with HP-UX: as of
HP-UX release 11.00, the sticky bit is very much supported, but HP-UX
doesn't use it on its /tmp directory as shipped.  Also as with the
permissions, some local policy might dictate that the stickiness is
not used.

(3) If the system supports the POSIX 'chown giveaway' feature and if
any of the parent directories of the temporary file back to the root
directory are 'unsafe', using the definitions given above in (1) and
(2).

See the documentation for the File::Temp module for more information
about the various security aspects.

REQUIREMENTS

Requires perl 5.005 or newer.
Perl 5.6.0 will give access to extra security checks.

Written completely in Perl. XS is not required.

File::Spec greater than or equal to 0.8 is required.
Fcntl from perl5.5.670 or higher [but will work without it].
The above two modules are standard on Perl 5.6

PLATFORMS

Tested on the following platforms:

 Redhat Linux 9, perl 5.8.0
 RedHat Linux 7, perl 5.6.0
 Solaris 2.6, perl 5.6.0
 Windows NT 4, perl 5.6.0
 VMS, perl5.7.0
 OS/2, perl5.7.0
 DOS/DJGPP, perl5.7.0

 RedHat Linux 6.1, perl 5.005_03
 Digital Unix 4.0, perl 5.005_03

File::Temp is a standard Perl module as of perl 5.7.0 and 5.6.1.

Still may need work on non-Unix platforms to adjust test severity (for example
stickyness test does not work on NT, and neither does unlink on an open
file). MEDIUM and HIGH security checks have only been tested on Unix.
Porting notes are provided at the start of Temp.pm.

CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

V0.14
      - new Object oriented interface. The file can now be deleted
	when the object goes out of scope:
          $tmp = new File::Temp;
	  print $tmp "Some data\n";
          print "Filename is $tmp\n";

      - MPE/IX fixes from Ken Hirsch

V0.13:
      - Documentation tweaks from Slaven Rezic and Jeffrey Friedl
      - MacOS patches from Chris Nandor
      - Test tweak from Andy Dougherty

V0.12:
      - Fix problem with Fcntl warnings on CGI and CGI::Carp 
            [Thanks to John Labovitz <johnl@valiha.inside.sealabs.com>]
      - Remove most of the carp warnings and wrap all information into a
        single croak (this allows security failures to die without 
        additional warnings getting in the way)

V0.11:
      - Fix bug on NT with O_TEMPORARY. The file was removed on close
        rather than on exit

V0.10:
      - More fixes for VMS
      - Add DOS/DJGPP support
      - Make security test less prone to failure on insecure systems
        since we are testing the module rather than the system.
      - Security tests is run in build dir and tmpdir

V0.09:
      - Add VMS support
      - OS/2 can not understand sticky bits

V0.08:
      - Improve performance by a factor of 3 over V0.07
      - Simplify the END block code
      - Ignore requests for HIGH or MEDIUM safety on platforms that 
        can not support it (rather than generating a fatal error)
      - Add OS/2 to list of platforms that can not unlink open file

V0.07:
      - Add support for perl 5.005. On perl 5.005 the HIGH and
        MEDIUM security levels are not supported due to changes in 
        the Fcntl module.

      - A benchmark has been added to the misc directory to compare
        IO::File->new_tmpfile, File::Temp and a simple creation wrapper
        around POSIX::tmpnam. On my Linux system File::Temp::tempfile()
        is an order of magnitude slower than the other two......

V0.06:
      - Add a test suite
      - Fix unlinking during the END blocks (was only removing the
        first file generated)
      - unlink0 can now be run on WinNT - the unlink of the file
        is now deferred to an END block since can not unlink an
        open file on WinNT
      - If the POSIX _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED symbol is not available
        it is assumed that "chown giveaway" is allowed.


V0.05: 
      - First release to CPAN
