    "# Application Containers \n",
    "\n",
    "Application Containers such as Docker and Singularity are an attractive way to to package software with complex dependencies to be used during workflow execution. Use of containers ensures that your application code always sees the same runtime environment, when a job in your workflow runs on a remote worker node. It minimizes the chances of running into errors related to differing versions of dependant libraries installed on the worker nodes where the jobs of your workflow run. Additonally, use of containers promotes reproducibility as they provide a fully defined and reproducible environment in which your jobs run.\n",

    "This section of the tutorial will explain how you can specify a **Docker** container in Pegasus, to indicate the container in which the jobs of your workflow run.\n",

    "This notebook will generate the **diamond workflow** that we used in Exercise 1. Instead of executing the executables directly on the worker node, we will specify a **base container image** in which the executables defined in the Transformation Catalog should execute in. \n",

    "## 7. Container Setup on a Worker Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have been able to run the workflow succesfully, lets look beneath the covers to see how a job that has to run in a container gets setup on a worker node. The container setup for a job happens within PegasusLite, a light-weight Pegasus remote execution engine which wraps the user task on the remote worker node when a job is scheduled to the node. \n",
    "\n",
    "PegasusLite is responsible for figuring out the appropriate job directory in which the job executes, staging-in datasets that a job requires, launching the job, staging-out data, and cleaning up the job directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Container Setup in PegasusLite](../images/container-host.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how Pegasus handled the container in this case, let’s look at some plumbing for one of the `analyze` job. The HTCondor submit file can be seen with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cat `find scitech/pegasus/blackdiamond/run0001 -name analyze_ID0000004.sub`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Look  at the transfer_input_files attribute line, and specifically for the `base-container` file. It is transferred together with all the other inputs for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "transfer_input_files = analyze,f.c2,f.c1,**base-container**,..\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the corresponding .sh file we can see how Pegasus executed the container by invoking `docker run` on a script written out at runtime."
