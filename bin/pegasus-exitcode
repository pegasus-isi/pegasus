# exitcode.py
#
# This program parses kickstart invocation records looking for failures.
# If failures are found, it prints a message and exits with a non-zero
# exit code. If no failures are found, it exits with 0.
#
# This program also renames the .out and .err file to .out.XXX and .err.XXX
# where XXX is a sequence number. This sequence number is incremented each
# time the program is run with the same kickstart.out argument.
#
# Since XML parsers are slow, this program doesn't parse the full invocation
# XML, but rather looks for the <status> tag in the XML and extracts the raw 
# exitcode using simple string manipulations. This turns out to be much
# faster than using an XML parser. On .out files with 1000 invocation
# records this program runs in about 30 milliseconds and uses less than 
# 4 MB of physical memory.
