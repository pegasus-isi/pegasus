    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This tutorial will take you through the steps of running simple
    workflows using Pegasus Workflow Management System. Pegasus allows
    scientists to</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Automate </emphasis>their scientific
        computational work, as portable workflows. Pegasus enables scientists
        to construct workflows in abstract terms without worrying about the
        details of the underlying execution environment or the particulars of
        the low-level specifications required by the middleware (Condor,
        Globus, or Amazon EC2). It automatically locates the necessary input
        data and computational resources necessary for workflow execution. It
        cleans up storage as the workflow is executed so that data-intensive
        workflows have enough space to execute on storage-constrained
        resources.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Recover </emphasis>from failures at
        runtime. When errors occur, Pegasus tries to recover when possible by
        retrying tasks, and when all else fails, provides a rescue workflow
        containing a description of only the work that remains to be done. It
        also enables users to move computations from one resource to another.
        Pegasus keeps track of what has been done (provenance) including the
        locations of data used and produced, and which software was used with
        which parameters.</para>

    <para>All of the steps in this tutorial are performed on the command-line.
    The convention we will use for command-line input and output is to put
    things that you should type in bold, monospace font, and to put the output
    you should get in a normal weight, monospace font, like this:</para>

    <programlisting>[user@host dir]$ <emphasis role="bold">you type this</emphasis>
you get this</programlisting>

    <para>Where <literal>[user@host dir]$</literal> is the terminal prompt,
    the text you should type is “<literal>you type this</literal>”, and the
    output you should get is "<literal>you get this</literal>". The terminal
    prompt will be abbreviated as <literal>$</literal>. Because some of the
    outputs are long, we don’t always include everything. Where the output is
    truncated we will add an ellipsis '...' to indicate the omitted
    output.</para>

    <para>Easiest way to start the tutorial is to connect to a hosted service
    using SSH as shown below.</para>

    <para><note>
        <para>The workflow dashboard is not run the hosted tutorial service.
        To try out the workflow dashboard use the virtual machines provided
        below.</para>
      </note></para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">OR</emphasis></para>

    <para>We have provided several virtual machines that contain all of the
    software required for this tutorial. Virtual machine images are provided
    for <link linkend="vm_virtualbox">VirtualBox</link> and <link
    linkend="vm_amazon">Amazon EC2</link>. Information about deploying the
    tutorial VM on these platforms is in <link linkend="tutorial_vm">the
    appendix</link>. If you want to use the tutorial VM, please go to the
    appendix for the platform you are using and follow the instructions for
    starting the VM found there before continuing with this tutorial.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Advanced Users:</emphasis> If you have
    installed Pegasus and Condor on your own machine, then you don't need to
    use the VM for the tutorial. If you installed Pegasus from one of the
    native packages (RPM, DEB, DMG), then you can find the tutorial files in
    <filename> /usr/share/doc/pegasus/tutorial</filename>. If you installed a
    binary tarball, or compiled Pegasus from source, then you can find the
    tutorial files in
    <filename>PEGASUS_HOME/share/doc/pegasus/tutorial</filename>. These files
    will need to be modified in several places to fix the paths to the users
    home directory (which is assumed to be <filename>/home/tutorial
    </filename>). It is assumed that Pegasus was installed from a native
    package, so the path to the Pegasus install is assumed to be
    <filename>/usr</filename>. Condor should be installed in the "Personal
    Condor" configuration. You will also need a passwordless ssh key to enable
    SCP file transfers to/from localhost. Getting everything set up correctly
    can be tricky, so we recommend getting started with one of the VMs if you
    are not familiar with Condor and UNIX.</para>

    <para>The remainder of this tutorial will assume that you have a terminal
    open to the directory where the tutorial files are installed. If you are
    using one of the tutorial VMs these files are located in the tutorial
    user's home directory <filename>/home/tutorial/examples</filename>.</para>

    <title>What are Scientific Workflows</title>

    <para>Scientific workflows allow users to easily express multi-step
    computational tasks, for example retrieve data from an instrument or a
    database, reformat the data, and run an analysis. A scientific workflow
    describes the dependencies between the tasks and in most cases the
    workflow is described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where the nodes
    are tasks and the edges denote the task dependencies. A defining property
    for a scientific workflow is that it manages data flow. The tasks in a
    scientific workflow can be everything from short serial tasks to very
    large parallel tasks (MPI for example) surrounded by a large number of
    small, serial tasks used for pre- and post-processing.</para>

    <para>Workflows can vary from simple to complex. Below are some examples.
    In the figures below, the task are designated by circles/ellipses while
    the files created by the tasks are indicated by rectangles. Arrows
    indicate task dependencies.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Process Workflow</emphasis></para>

    <para>It consists of a single task that runs the `ls` command and
    generates a listing of the files in the `/` directory.</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Pipeline of Tasks</emphasis></para>

    <para>The pipeline workflow consists of two tasks linked together in a
    pipeline. The first job runs the `curl` command to fetch the Pegasus home
    page and store it as an HTML file. The result is passed to the `wc`
    command, which counts the number of lines in the HTML file. <figure>

      </figure></para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Split Workflow</emphasis></para>

    <para>The split workflow downloads the Pegasus home page using the `curl`
    command, then uses the `split` command to divide it into 4 pieces. The
    result is passed to the `wc` command to count the number of lines in each
    piece.<figure>

      </figure></para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Merge Workflow</emphasis></para>

    <para>The merge workflow runs the `ls` command on several */bin
    directories and passes the results to the `cat` command, which merges the
    files into a single listing. The merge workflow is an example of a
    parameter sweep over arguments.<figure>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Complex Workflows</emphasis></para>

    <para>The above examples can be used as building blocks for much complex
    workflows. Some of these are showcased on the <ulink

    <title>Submitting an Example Workflow</title>

    <para>The tutorial comes configured with a variety of examples. For the
    rest of the tutorial we will be using the split example. Other examples
    are also structured similarly.</para>

    <para>The input workflow description for Pegasus is called the DAX. In
    each of the example directories, there is a file with a .dax extension. We
    will cover on how to create the DAX programmatically later in the <link
    linkend="tutorial_wf_generation">tutorial</link>. Pegasus takes in the DAX
    and generates an executable HTCondor workflow that is run on an execution
    site.</para>

    <para>The <literal>pegasus-plan</literal> command is used to submit the
    workflow through Pegasus. If you have trouble copy pasting into the VM,
    you can also invoke the <filename>plan_dax.sh</filename> wrapper script
    that has all of the arguments required for the split workflow:</para>

    <para>The pegasus-plan command takes in the input workflow ( DAX file
    specified by --dax option) and maps the abstract DAX to one or more
    execution sites, and submits the generated executable workflow for

    <title>Workflow Dashboard for Monitoring and Debugging</title>

    <para><note>
        <para>If you are running this tutorial through the hosted service then
        skip this step. To try out the workflow dashboard use the virtual
        machines provided above.</para>
      </note></para>

    <para>The Pegasus Dashboard is a web interface for monitoring and
    debugging workflows and is shipped with each Pegasus release. We will now
    use the web dashboard to monitor the status of the workflow.</para>

    <para>By default, the dashboard server can only monitor workflows run by
    the current user i.e. the user who is running the pegasus-service.</para>

    <para>To access the workflow dashboard, in the VirtualBox VM you can
    launch Firefox by clicking the Firefox icon in the top menu of the
    desktop. The home page for the dashboard is accessible at
    https://localhost:5000 . If you are using EC2 you will need to replace
    'localhost' with the IP address of your EC2 instance.</para>

    <para>When the webpage loads up, it will ask you for a username and a
    password. Log in as user "<emphasis role="bold">tutorial</emphasis>" with
    password "<emphasis role="bold">pegasus</emphasis>".</para>

    <para>The Dashboard's home page lists all workflows, which have been run
    by the current-user. The home page shows the status of each of the
    workflow i.e. Running/Successful/Failed/Failing. The home page lists only
    the top level workflows (Pegasus supports hierarchical workflows i.e.
    workflows within a workflow). The rows in the table are color coded</para>

    <para>To view details specific to a workflow, the user can click on
    corresponding workflow label. The workflow details page lists workflow
    specific information like workflow label, workflow status, location of the
    submit directory, etc. The details page also displays pie charts showing
    the distribution of jobs based on status.</para>

    <para>In addition, the details page displays a tab listing all
    sub-workflows and their statuses. Additional tabs exist which list
    information for all running, failed, successful, and failing jobs.</para>

    <para>The information displayed for a job depends on it's status. For
    example, the failed jobs tab displays the job name, exit code, links to
    available standard output, and standard error contents.</para>

    <para>To view details specific to a job the user can click on the
    corresponding job's job label. The job details page lists information
    relevant to a specific job. For example, the page lists information like
    job name, exit code, run time, etc.</para>

    <para>The job instance section of the job details page lists all attempts
    made to run the job i.e. if a job failed in its first attempt due to
    transient errors, but ran successfully when retried, the job instance
    section shows two entries; one for each attempt to run the job.</para>

    <para>The job details page also shows tab's for failed, and successful
    task invocations (Pegasus allows users to group multiple smaller task's

#
# Workflow summary:
#   Summary of the workflow execution. It shows total
#   tasks/jobs/sub workflows run, how many succeeded/failed etc.
#   In case of hierarchical workflow the calculation shows the
#   statistics across all the sub workflows.It shows the following
#   statistics about tasks, jobs and sub workflows.
#     * Succeeded - total count of succeeded tasks/jobs/sub workflows.
#     * Failed - total count of failed tasks/jobs/sub workflows.
#     * Incomplete - total count of tasks/jobs/sub workflows that are
#       not in succeeded or failed state. This includes all the jobs
#       that are not submitted, submitted but not completed etc. This
#       is calculated as  difference between 'total' count and sum of
#       'succeeded' and 'failed' count.
#     * Total - total count of tasks/jobs/sub workflows.
#     * Retries - total retry count of tasks/jobs/sub workflows.
#     * Total+Retries - total count of tasks/jobs/sub workflows executed
#       during workflow run. This is the cumulative of retries,
#       succeeded and failed count.
# Workflow wall time:
#   The wall time from the start of the workflow execution to the end as
#   reported by the DAGMAN.In case of rescue dag the value is the
#   cumulative of all retries.
# Workflow cumulative job wall time:
#   The sum of the wall time of all jobs as reported by kickstart.
#   In case of job retries the value is the cumulative of all retries.
#   For workflows having sub workflow jobs (i.e SUBDAG and SUBDAX jobs),
#   the wall time value includes jobs from the sub workflows as well.
# Cumulative job wall time as seen from submit side:
#   The sum of the wall time of all jobs as reported by DAGMan.
#   This is similar to the regular cumulative job wall time, but includes
#   job management overhead and delays. In case of job retries the value
#   is the cumulative of all retries. For workflows having sub workflow
#   jobs (i.e SUBDAG and SUBDAX jobs), the wall time value includes jobs
#   from the sub workflows as well.
# Cumulative job wall time as seen from submit side:
#   The sum of the wall time of all jobs as reported by DAGMan.
#   This is similar to the regular cumulative job wall time, but includes
#   job management overhead and delays. In case of job retries the value
#   is the cumulative of all retries. For workflows having sub workflow
#   jobs (i.e SUBDAG and SUBDAX jobs), the wall time value includes jobs
#   from the sub workflows as well.
# Workflow cumulative job badput wall time:
#   The sum of the wall time of all failed jobs as reported by kickstart.
#   In case of job retries the value is the cumulative of all retries.
#   For workflows having sub workflow jobs (i.e SUBDAG and SUBDAX jobs),
#   the wall time value includes jobs from the sub workflows as well.
# Cumulative job badput wall time as seen from submit side:
#   The sum of the wall time of all failed jobs as reported by DAGMan.

    <title>Recovery from Failures</title>

    <para>Executing workflows in a distributed environment can lead to
    failures. Often, they are a result of the underlying infrastructure being
    temporarily unavailable, or errors in workflow setup such as incorrect
    executables specified, or input files being unavailable.</para>

    <para>In case of transient infrastructure failures such as a node being
    temporarily down in a cluster, Pegasus will automatically retry jobs in
    case of failure. After a set number of retries ( usually once) , a hard
    failure occurs, because of which workflow will eventually fail.</para>

    <para>In most of the cases, these errors are correctable ( either the
    resource comes back online or application errors are fixed) . Once the
    errors are fixed, you may not want to start a new workflow but instead
    start from the point of failure. In order to do this, you can submit the
    rescue workflows automatically created in case of failures. A rescue
    workflow contains only a description of only the work that remains to be
    done.</para>

      <title>Submitting Rescue Workflows</title>

    <title>Generating the Workflow</title>

    <para>The example that you ran earlier already had the workflow
    description (split.dax) generated. Pegasus reads workflow descriptions
    from DAX files. The term “DAX” is short for “Directed Acyclic Graph in
    XML”. DAX is an XML file format that has syntax for expressing jobs,
    arguments, files, and dependencies. We now will be creating the split
    workflow that we just ran using the Pegasus provided DAX API:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Split Workflow</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" contentwidth="70%"
                     fileref="images/tutorial-split-wf.jpg"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>In this diagram, the ovals represent computational jobs, the
    dog-eared squares are files, and the arrows are dependencies.</para>

    <para>In order to create a DAX it is necessary to write code for a DAX
    generator. Pegasus comes with Perl, Java, and Python libraries for writing
    DAX generators. In this tutorial we will show how to use the Python
    library.</para>

    <para>The DAX generator for the split workflow is in the file
    <filename>generate_dax.py</filename>. Look at the file by typing:</para>

    <programlisting>$ <emphasis role="bold">more generate_dax.py</emphasis>
...</programlisting>

    <tip>
      <para>We will be using the <literal>more</literal> command to inspect
      several files in this tutorial. <literal>more</literal> is a pager
      application, meaning that it splits text files into pages and displays
      the pages one at a time. You can view the next page of a file by
      pressing the spacebar. Type 'h' to get help on using
      <literal>more</literal>. When you are done, you can type 'q' to close
      the file.</para>
    </tip>

    <para>The code has 3 main sections:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>A new ADAG object is created. This is the main object to which
        jobs and dependencies are added.</para>

        <programlisting># Create a abstract dag
dax = ADAG("split")
...
</programlisting>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Jobs and files are added. The 5 jobs in the diagram above are
        added and 9 files are referenced. Arguments are defined using strings
        and File objects. The input and output files are defined for each job.
        This is an important step, as it allows Pegasus to track the files,
        and stage the data if necessary. Workflow outputs are tagged with
        “transfer=true”.</para>

        <programlisting># the split job that splits the webpage into smaller chunks
webpage = File("pegasus.html")

split = Job("split")
split.addArguments("-l","100","-a","1",webpage,"part.")
split.uses(webpage, link=Link.INPUT)
dax.addJob(split)

...
</programlisting>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Dependencies are added. These are shown as arrows in the diagram
        above. They define the parent/child relationships between the jobs.
        When the workflow is executing, the order in which the jobs will be
        run is determined by the dependencies between them.</para>

        <programlisting># Add control-flow dependencies
dax.depends(wc, split)

  <section id="tutorial_catalogs">
    <title>Information Catalogs</title>

    <para>The workflow description (DAX) that you specify to Pegasus is
    portable, and usually does not contain any locations to physical input
    files, executables or cluster end points where jobs are executed. Pegasus
    uses three information catalogs during the planning process.</para>

    <section id="tut_site_catalog">
      <title>The Site Catalog</title>

      <para>The site catalog describes the sites where the workflow jobs are
      to be executed. In this tutorial we assume that you have a Personal
      Condor pool running on localhost. If you are using one of the tutorial
      VMs this has already been setup for you. The site catalog for the
      tutorial examples is in <filename>sites.xml</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>$ <emphasis role="bold">more sites.xml</emphasis>

﻿   &lt;!-- The local site contains information about the submit host --&gt;
    &lt;!-- The arch and os keywords are used to match binaries in the transformation catalog --&gt;
    &lt;site handle="local" arch="x86_64" os="LINUX"&gt;

        <emphasis role="bold">&lt;!-- These are the paths on the submit host were Pegasus stores data --&gt;
        &lt;!-- Scratch is where temporary files go --&gt;</emphasis>
        &lt;directory type="shared-scratch" path="/home/tutorial/run"&gt;
            &lt;file-server operation="all" url="file:///home/tutorial/run"/&gt;
        &lt;/directory&gt;

       <emphasis role="bold"> &lt;!-- Storage is where pegasus stores output files --&gt;</emphasis>

        &lt;profile namespace="env" key="SSH_PRIVATE_KEY"&gt;/home/tutorial/.ssh/id_rsa&lt;/profile&gt;
    &lt;/site&gt;


...</programlisting>

      <para>There are two sites defined in the site catalog: “<emphasis
      role="bold">local</emphasis>” and “<emphasis
      role="bold">PegasusVM</emphasis>”. The “local” site is used by Pegasus
      to learn about the submit host where the workflow management system
      runs. The “PegasusVM” site is the personal Condor pool running on your
      (virtual) machine. In this case, the local site and the PegasusVM site
      refer to the same machine, but they are logically separate as far as
      Pegasus is concerned.</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The <emphasis role="bold">local</emphasis> site is configured
          with a “storage” file system that is mounted on the submit host
          (indicated by the file:// URL). This file system is where the output
          data from the workflow will be stored. When the workflow is planned
          we will tell Pegasus that the output site is “local”.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The <emphasis role="bold">PegasusVM</emphasis> site is
          configured with a “scratch” file system accessible via SCP
          (indicated by the scp:// URL). This file system is where the working
          directory will be created. When we plan the workflow we will tell
          Pegasus that the execution site is “PegasusVM”.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>The local site also has an environment variable called <emphasis
      role="bold">SSH_PRIVATE_KEY</emphasis> that tells Pegasus where to find
      the private key to use for SCP transfers. If you are running this
      tutorial on your own machine you will need to set up a passwordless ssh
      key and add it to authorized_keys. If you are using the tutorial VM this
      has already been set up for you.</para>

      <para>Pegasus supports many different file transfer protocols. In this
      case the site catalog is set up so that input and output files are
      transferred to/from the PegasusVM site using SCP. Since both the local
      site and the PegasusVM site are actually the same machine, this
      configuration will just SCP files to/from localhost, which is just a
      complicated way to copy the files.</para>

      <para>Finally, the PegasusVM site is configured with two profiles that
      tell Pegasus that it is a plain Condor pool. Pegasus supports many ways
      of submitting tasks to a remote cluster. In this configuration it will
      submit vanilla Condor jobs.</para>

      <section>

        below. The site catalog, captures for each cluster (site)</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> Replica Catalog
      configuration is not required for the tutorial setup. It is only
      required if you want to refer to input files on external servers.</para>

      <para>The example that you ran , was configured with the inputs already
      present on the submit host ( where pegasus is installed) in a directory.
      If you have inputs at external servers, then you can specify the URL's
      to the input files in the Replica Catalog. This catalog tells Pegasus
      where to find each of the input files for the workflow.</para>

      <para>All files in a Pegasus workflow are referred to in the DAX using
      their Logical File Name (LFN). These LFNs are mapped to Physical File
      Names (PFNs) when Pegasus plans the workflow. This level of indirection
      enables Pegasus to map abstract DAXes to different execution sites and
      plan out the required file transfers automatically.</para>

      <para>The Replica Catalog for the diamond workflow is in the
      <filename>rc.dat</filename> file:</para>

      <programlisting>$ <emphasis role="bold">more rc.dat</emphasis>

<emphasis role="bold"># </emphasis>This is the replica catalog. It lists information about each of the
# input files used by the workflow. You can use this to specify locations to input files present on external servers.<emphasis
          role="bold">

</emphasis>
# The format is:
# LFN     PFN    site="SITE"

f.a    file:///home/tutorial/examples/diamond/input/f.a    site="local"</programlisting>

      <note>
        <para>In our tutorial, input files are on the submit host and we used
        the --input dir option to # pegasus-plan to specify where they are
        located.</para>
      </note>

      <para>This replica catalog contains only one entry for the diamond
      workflow’s only input file. This entry has an LFN of “f.a” with a PFN of
      “file:///home/tutorial/input/f.a” and the file is stored on the local
      site, which implies that it will need to be transferred to the PegasusVM
      site when the workflow runs.</para>

    <title>Configuring Pegasus</title>

    <para>In addition to the information catalogs, Pegasus takes a
    configuration file that specifies settings that control how it plans the
    workflow.</para>

    <para>For the diamond workflow, the Pegasus configuration file is
    relatively simple. It only contains settings to help Pegasus find the
    information catalogs. These settings are in the
    <filename>pegasus.conf</filename> file:</para>

# This tells Pegasus where to find the Site Catalog
pegasus.catalog.site.file=sites.xml

# This tells Pegasus where to find the Replica Catalog
pegasus.catalog.replica=File
pegasus.catalog.replica.file=rc.dat

# This tells Pegasus where to find the Transformation Catalog
pegasus.catalog.transformation=Text
pegasus.catalog.transformation.file=tc.txt</programlisting>
