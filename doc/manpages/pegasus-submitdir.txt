Name
----
pegasus-submitdir - Manage a workflow submit directory.

Synopsis
--------
[verse]
*pegasus-submitdir* 'COMMAND' [options] 'SUBMITDIR'

Description
-----------
*pegasus-submitdir* is used to manage submit directories generated by the
Pegasus planner.

The *archive* command significantly reduces the size of workflow submit
directories by compressing the data in a way such that it remains accessible
to tools such as pegasus-statistics, pegasus-plots, and pegasus-analyzer.

The *extract* command reverses the effect of the *archive* command.

The *move* command relocates a submit directory and updates relevant pointers
in the database so that it can still be accessed through the dashboard.

The *delete* command removes the submit directory and cleans up any associated
records in the user's master database.

The *attach* command adds a submit dir to the master database that drives the
dashboard.

The *detach* command removes a submit dir from the master database that drives
the dashboard.

Commands
--------
*archive* SUBMITDIR::
    Compresses a workflow submit directory in a way that allows
    pegasus-dashboard, pegasus-statistics, pegasus-plots, and
    pegasus-analyzer to keep working. It creates a gzipped tar archive of
    the submit files and logs that excludes files such as the workflow
    database, braindump file, and monitord logs, which are used by pegasus
    reporting tools.

*extract* SUBMITDIR::
    Uncompresses a previously archived submit directory. This option returns
    the submit directory to the state it was before *pegasus-submitdir archive*
    was applied to it.

*move* SUBMITDIR DEST::
    Move a workflow submit dir from SUBMITDIR to DEST. This operation updates
    the relevant database records so that the dashboard continues to function.
    DEST can be either an existing directory, in which case the submit dir
    becomes a subdirectory, or a new path, in which case the submit dir is
    renamed. *IMPORTANT* This operation should only be performed on
    workflows that will not be resubmitted in the future. Moving a workflow
    does not update absolute paths in any of the submit files, so after a
    workflow has been moved it is not possible to rerun it.

*delete* SUBMITDIR::
    Delete a workflow submit dir. This operation removes all related records
    from the user's master database, including ensemble manager records.
    Deleted workflows do not appear in the dashboard.

*attach* SUBMITDIR::
    Add entries for the workflow in SUBMITDIR to the user's master db. If the
    workflow is already in the master db, then update the db_url and submit_dir
    fields to match the actual path of the submit dir. This command will create
    master_workflow and master_workflowstate entries in the master db for the
    root workflow in SUBMITDIR.

*detach* [--wf-uuid <WF_UUID>] SUBMITDIR::
    Remove entries for the workflow in SUBMITDIR from the user's master db.
    This command will delete any entries in the master_workflow and
    master_workflowstate tables.
