Description
-----------
*pegasus-kickstart* is a wrapper program which manages and monitors the
execution of jobs on remote resources.

Sitting in between the remote scheduler and the application process, it is
possible for *pegasus-kickstart* to gather additional information about 
the process' run-time behavior and resource usage, including the exit 
status of jobs. This information is important for Pegasus invocation 
tracking as well as detecting Globus GRAM job failures.

*pegasus-kickstart* allows the optional execution of jobs before and after 
the main application job that run in chained execution with the main application
job. See section <<SUBJOBS, *SUBJOBS*>> for details about this feature.

It also allows stdin, stdout, and stderr to be redirected from/to specific
files.

All jobs with relative path specifications to the application are part
of search relative to the current working directory (yes, this is unsafe),
and by prepending each component from the 'PATH' environment variable. 
The first match is used. Jobs that use absolute pathnames, starting in a 
slash, are exempt. Using an absolute path to your executable is the safe 
and recommended option. 

*pegasus-kickstart* rewrites the command line of any job (pre, post and 
main) with variable substitutions from Unix environment variables. See 
section <<VARIABLE_REWRITING, *VARIABLE REWRITING*>> below for details on 
this feature.


Options
-------
*-n* 'tr'::
In order to associate the minimal performance information of the job
with the invocation records, the jobs needs to carry which
'transformation' was responsible for producing it. The format
is the textual notation for fully-qualified definition names, like
namespace::name:version, with only the name portion being mandatory.
+
There is no default. If no value is given, "null" will be reported.

*-N* 'dv'::
The jobs may carry which instantiation of a transformation was
responsible for producing it. The format is the textual notation for
fully-qualified definition names, like namespace::name:version, with
only the name portion being mandatory.
+
There is no default. If no value is given, "null" will be reported.

*-H*::
This option avoids pegasus-kickstart writing the XML preamble (entity), if you 
need to combine multiple pegasus-kickstart records into one document. 
+
Additionally, if specified, the environment and the resource usage
segments will not be written, assuming that a in a concatenated
record version, the initial run will have captured those settings. 

*-R* 'site'::
In order to provide the greater picture, pegasus-kickstart can reflect the
site handle (resource identifier) into its output. 
+
There is no default. If no value is given, the attribute will not be
generated. 

*-L* 'lbl'::
*-T* 'iso'::
These optional arguments denote the workflow label (from DAX) and the 
workflow's last modification time (from DAX). The label 'lbl'
can be any sensible string of up to 32 characters, but should use C
identifier characters. The timestamp 'iso' must be an ISO 8601 compliant 
time-stamp.

*-S* 'l=p'::
If stat information on any file is required 'before' any jobs were started,
logical to physical file mappings to stat can be passed using the *-S* 
option. The LFN and PFN are concatenated by an equals (=) sign. The
LFN is optional: If no equals sign is found, the argument is taken as 
sole PFN specification without LFN.
+
This option may be specified multiple times. To reduce and overcome
command line length limits, if the argument is prefixed with an at (@) 
sign, the argument is taken to be a textual file of LFN to PFN mappings.
The optionality mentioned above applies. Each line inside the file
argument is the name of a file to stat. Comments (#) and empty lines
are permitted.
+
Each PFN will incur a 'statcall' record (element) with attribute 'id'
set to value 'initial'. The optional 'lfn' attribute is set to the 
LFN stat'ed. The filename is part of the 'statinfo' record inside.
+
There is no default.

*-s* 'fn'::
If stat information on any file is required 'after' all jobs have finished,
logical to physical file mappings to stat can be passed using the *-s* 
option. The LFN and PFN are concatenated by an equals (=) sign. The
LFN is optional: If no equals sign is found, the argument is taken as 
sole PFN specification without LFN.
+
This option may be specified multiple times. To reduce and overcome
commandline length limits, if the argument is prefixed with an at (@) 
sign, the argument is taken to be a textual file of LFN to PFN mappings.
The optionality mentioned above applies. Each line inside the file
argument is the name of a file to stat. Comments (#) and empty lines
are permitted.
+
Each PFN will incur a 'statcall' record (element) with attribute 'id'
set to value 'final'. The optional 'lfn' attribute is set to the LFN 
stat'ed. The filename is part of the 'statinfo' record inside.
+
There is no default.

*-i* 'fn'::
This option allows *pegasus-kickstart* to re-connect the stdin of the 
application that it starts. Use a single hyphen to share 'stdin' 
with the one provided to *pegasus-kickstart*.
+
The default is to connect 'stdin' to '/dev/null'.

*-o* 'fn'::
This option allows *pegasus-kickstart* to re-connect the 'stdout' 
of the application that it starts. The mode is used whenever an application
produces meaningful results on its 'stdout' that need to be tracked by 
Pegasus. The real 'stdout' of Globus jobs is staged via GASS (GT2) or 
RFT (GT4). The real 'stdout' is used to propagate the invocation record 
back to the submit site. Use the single hyphen to share the application's
'stdout' with the one that is provided to *pegasus-kickstart*. In that 
case, the output from *pegasus-kickstart* will interleave with application 
output. For this reason, such a mode is not recommended.
+
In order to provide an un-captured 'stdout' as part of the results, it is 
the default to connect the 'stdout' of the application to a temporary file. 
The content of this temporary file will be transferred as payload data in 
the *pegasus-kickstart* results. The content size is subject to payload 
limits, see the *-B* option. If the content grows large, only the last 
portion will become part of the payload. If the temporary file grows too 
large, it may flood the worker node's temporary space. The temporary file 
will be deleted after *pegasus-kickstart* finishes.
+
If the filename is prefixed with an exclamation point, the file will
be opened in append mode instead of overwrite mode. Note that you may
need to escape the exclamation point from the shell.
+
The default is to connect 'stdout' to a temporary file. 

*-e* 'fn'::
This option allows *pegasus-kickstart* to re-connect the 'stderr'
of the application that it starts. This option is used whenever an
application produces meaningful results on 'stderr' that needs tracking 
by Pegasus. The real 'stderr' of Globus jobs is staged via GASS (GT2) 
or RFT (GT4). It is used to propagate abnormal behavior from both,
*pegasus-kickstart* and the application that it starts, though its 
main use is to propagate application dependent data and heartbeats. 
Use a single hyphen to share 'stderr' with the 'stderr' that is 
provided to *pegasus-kickstart*. This is the backward compatible 
behavior.
+
In order to provide an un-captured 'stderr' as part of the results, by 
default the 'stderr' of the application will be connected to a temporary 
file. Its content is transferred as payload data in the *pegasus-kickstart*
results. If too large, only the last portion will become part of
the payload. If the temporary file grows too large, it may flood the
worker node's temporary space. The temporary file will be deleted after
*pegasus-kickstart* finishes.
+
If the filename is prefixed with an exclamation point, the file will
be opened in append mode instead of overwrite mode. Note that you may
need to escape the exclamation point from the shell.
+
The default is to connect 'stderr' to a temporary file.

*-l* 'logfn'::
allows to append the performance data to the specified file. Thus,
multiple XML documents may end up in the same file, including their XML
preamble. 'stdout' is normally used to stream back the results. Usually, 
this is a GASS-staged stream. Use a single hyphen to generate the output 
on the 'stdout' that was provided to *pegasus-kickstart*, the default 
behavior.
+
Default is to append the invocation record onto the provided 'stdout'.

*-w* 'dir'::
permits the explicit setting of a new working directory once pegasus-kickstart
is started. This is useful in a remote scheduling environment, when the
chosen working directory is not visible on the job submitting host. If
the directory does not exist, *pegasus-kickstart* will fail. This option is 
mutually exclusive with the *-W* 'dir' option.
+
Default is to use the working directory that the application was started
in. This is usually set up by a remote scheduling environment. 

*-W* 'dir'::
permits the explicit creation and setting of a new working directory
once pegasus-kickstart is started. This is useful in a remote scheduling
environment, when the chosen working directory is not visible on the job
submitting host. If the directory does not exist, *pegasus-kickstart* 
will attempt to create it, and then change into it. Both, creation and
directory change may still fail. This option is mutually exclusive with
the *-w* 'dir' option.
+
Default is to use the working directory that the application was started
in. This is usually set up by a remote scheduling environment. 

*-X*::
make an application executable, no matter what. It is a work-around code
for a weakness of *globus-url-copy* which does not copy the permissions 
of the source to the destination. Thus, if an executable is staged-in 
using GridFTP, it will have the wrong permissions. Specifying the *-X* 
flag will attempt to change the mode to include the necessary x (and r)
bits to make the application executable. 
+
Default is not to change the mode of the application. Note that this
feature can be misused by hackers, as it is attempted to call chmod
on whatever path is specified. 

*-B* 'sz'::
Changes the amount of stdout and stderr data to include in the output.
The last 'sz' bytes of the stdout and stderr of the process will be copied
into kickstart's output. All other data will be discarded. The special
value 'all' can be used to capture all the stdout/stderr of the process.
The default is 256KB.

*-F*::
This flag will issue an explicit *fsync()* call on kickstart's own 'stdout'
file. Typically you won't need this flag. Albeit, certain shared file
system situations may improve when adding a flush after the written
invocation record.
+
The default is to just use kickstart's NFS alleviation strategy by
locking and unlocking 'stdout'.

*-I* 'fn'::
In this mode, the application name and any arguments to the application
are specified inside of file 'fn'. The file contains one argument per line. 
Escaping from Globus, Condor and shell meta characters is not required. This 
mode permits to use the maximum possible command line length of the 
underlying operating system, e.g. 128k for Linux. Using the *-I* mode stops 
any further command line processing of *pegasus-kickstart* command lines. 
+
Default is to use the 'app flags' mode, where the application is specified 
explicitly on the command-line.

*-f*::
This flag causes kickstart to output full information, including the
environment and resource limits under which the job ran, and any useful
auxilliary statcalls. If the job fails, then *-f* is implied.

*-k* 'S'::
This flag causes kickstart to send the job a SIGTERM if it is still running
after S seconds.  The default value is 0, which disables the timeout.

*-K* 'S'::
This flag causes kickstart to send the job a SIGKILL if it is still running S
seconds after recieving a SIGTERM sent as a result of the *-k* flag. The default
value is 5. If *-k* is not set, or is set to 0, then this flag is ignored.

*-t*::
This flag causes kickstart to use ptrace() to collect resource usage info
for the process by intercepting the process start and stop events. This flag
only exists when kickstart is compiled for Linux.

*-z*::
This flag causes kickstart to use ptrace() to intercept system calls and report
a list of files accessed and I/O performed. This flag only exists when
kickstart is compiled for Linux.

*-Z*::
This flag causes kickstart to use LD_PRELOAD to intercept library calls and
report a list of files accessed and I/O performed. This flag only exists when
kickstart is compiled for Linux. There are several environment variables
documented below that control what file accesses are traced.

*-q*::
This flag causes kickstart to omit the <data> part of the <statcall> records
when the job exits successfully. This is designed to reduce the size of the
output logs for large workflows.

*-c*::
This flag causes kickstart to output <data> from stdout and stderr as a CDATA
section instead of quoting it.

'app'::
The path to the application has to be completely specified. The application 
is a mandatory option.

'appflags'::
Application may or may not have additional flags.


Return Value
------------
*pegasus-kickstart* will return the return value of the main job. In 
addition, the error code 127 signals that the call to exec failed, and 
126 that reconnecting the stdio failed. A job failing with the same 
exit codes is indistinguishable from *pegasus-kickstart* failures.

[[SUBJOBS]]
Subjobs
-------
Subjobs are a new feature and may have a few wrinkles left.

In order to allow specific setups and assertion checks for compute nodes,
*pegasus-kickstart* allows the optional execution of a 'prejob'. This
'prejob' is anything that the remote compute node is capable of executing. 
For modern Unix systems, this includes #! scripts interpreter invocations,
as long as the x bits on the executed file are set. The main job is run
if and only if the prejob returned regularly with an exit code of zero.

With similar restrictions, the optional execution of a 'postjob' is 
chained to the success of the main job. The postjob will be run, if the 
main job terminated normally with an exit code of zero. 

In addition, a user may specify a 'setup' and a 'cleanup' job. The 'setup' 
job sets up the remote execution environment. The 'cleanup' job may tear 
down and clean-up after any job ran. Failure to run the setup job has no 
impact on subsequent jobs. The cleanup is a job that will even be attempted 
to run for all failed jobs. No job information is passed. If you need to 
invoke multiple setup or clean-up jobs, bundle them into a script, and 
invoke the clean-up script. Failure of the clean-up job is not meant to 
affect the progress of the remote workflow (DAGMan). This may change in 
the future.

The setup-, pre-, and post- and cleanup-job run on the same compute node
as the main job to execute. However, since they run in separate
processes as children of *pegasus-kickstart*, they are unable to influence 
each others nor the main jobs environment settings.

All jobs and their arguments are subject to variable substitutions as
explained in the next section.

To specify the prejob, insert the the application invocation and any
optional commandline argument into the environment variable 
'KICKSTART_PREJOB'. If you are invoking from a shell, you might want to 
use single quotes to protect against the shell. If you are invoking from 
Globus, you can append the RSL string feature. From Condor, you can use 
Condor's notion of environment settings. In Pegasus use the 'profile'
command to set generic scripts that will work on multiple sites, 
or the transformation catalog to set environment variables in a pool-specific
fashion. Please remember that the execution of the main job is chained
to the success of the prejob. 

To set up the postjob, use the environment variable 'KICKSTART_POSTJOB'
to point to an application with potential arguments to execute. The same
restrictions as for the prejob apply. Please note that the execution of
the post job is chained to the main job. 

To provide the independent setup job, use the environment variable
'KICKSTART_SETUP'. The exit code of the setup job has no influence on the 
remaining chain of jobs. To provide an independent cleanup job, use the 
environment variable 'KICKSTART_CLEANUP' to point to an application with 
possible arguments to execute. The same restrictions as for prejob and 
postjob apply. The cleanup is run regardless of the exit status of any 
other jobs.


[[VARIABLE_REWRITING]]
Variable Rewriting
------------------
Variable substitution is a new feature and may have a few wrinkles left.

The variable substitution employs simple rules from the Bourne shell
syntax. Simple quoting rules for backslashed characters, double quotes
and single quotes are obeyed. Thus, in order to pass a dollar sign to
as argument to your job, it must be escaped with a backslash from the 
variable rewriting.

For pre- and postjobs, double quotes allow the preservation of whitespace
and the insertion of special characters like \a (alarm), \b (backspace),
\n (newline), \r (carriage return), \t (horizontal tab), and \v 
(vertical tab). Octal modes are 'not' allowed. Variables are still 
substituted in double quotes. Single quotes inside double quotes have no 
special meaning.

Inside single quotes, no variables are expanded. The backslash only
escapes a single quote or backslash. 

Backticks are not supported.

Variables are only substituted once. You cannot have variables in
variables. If you need this feature, please request it. 

Outside quotes, arguments from the pre- and postjob are split on linear
whitespace. The backslash makes the next character verbatim. 

Variables that are rewritten must start with a dollar sign either
outside quotes or inside double quotes. The dollar may be followed by a
valid identifier. A valid identifier starts with a letter or the
underscore. A valid identifier may contain further letters, digits or
underscores. The identifier is case sensitive. 

The alternative use is to enclose the identifier inside curly braces. In
this case, almost any character is allowed for the identifier, including
whitespace. This is the 'only' curly brace expansion. No other Bourne magic 
involving curly braces is supported.

One of the advantages of variable substitution is, for example, the
ability to specify the application as '$HOME/bin/app1' 
in the transformation catalog, and thus to gridstart. As long as your
home directory on any compute node has a 'bin' 
directory that contains the application, the transformation catalog does
not need to care about the true location of the application path on each
pool. Even better, an administrator may decide to move your home
directory to a different place. As long as the compute node is set up
correctly, you don't have to adjust any Pegasus data.

Mind that variable substitution is an expert feature, as some degree of
tricky quoting is required to protect substitutable variables and quotes
from Globus, Condor and Pegasus in that order. Note that Condor uses the
dollar sign for its own variables. 

The variable substitution assumptions for the main job differ
slightly from the prejob and postjob for technical reasons. The pre-
and postjob command lines are passed as one string. However, the main
jobs command line is already split into pieces by the time it reaches
*pegasus-kickstart*.
Thus, any whitespace on the main job's command line must be preserved,
and further argument splitting avoided.

It is highly recommended to experiment on the Unix command line with the
'echo' and 'env' applications to obtain a feeling for the different 
quoting mechanisms needed to achieve variable substitution. 


Example
-------
You can run the *pegasus-kickstart* executable locally to verify that 
it is functioning well. In the initial phase, the format of the 
performance data may be slightly adjusted.
----------
$ env KICKSTART_PREJOB='/bin/usleep 250000' \\
  KICKSTART_POSTJOB='/bin/date -u' \\
  pegasus-kickstart -l xx \\$PEGASUS_HOME/bin/keg -T1 -o-
$ cat xx
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
  ...
  </statcall>
</invocation>
----------
Please take note a few things in the above example:

The output from the postjob is appended to the output of the main job on
'stdout'. The output could potentially be separated into different data 
sections through different temporary files. If you truly need the separation,
request that feature.

The log file is reported with a size of zero, because the log file did
indeed barely exist at the time the data structure was (re-)
initialized. With regular GASS output, it will report the status of the
socket file descriptor, though.

The file descriptors reported for the temporary files are from the 
perspective of *pegasus-kickstart*. Since the temporary files have the 
close-on-exec flag set, *pegasus-kickstart*'s file descriptors are invisible 
to the job processes. Still, the 'stdio' of the job processes are connected 
to the temporary files.

Even this output already appears large. The output may already be too
large to guarantee that the append operation on networked pipes (GASS,
NFS) are atomically written.

The current format of the performance data is as follows:

Timeouts
--------
Kickstart sets timeouts for the job based on the *-k* and *-K* flags. The *-k*
flag sets the time kickstart will wait before it sends the job a SIGTERM, and
the *-K* flag sets the time kickstart will wait after delivering a SIGTERM until
it delivers a SIGKILL. The *-K* timeout is designed to give the job some time
to write a checkpoint, which it can trigger by handling the SIGTERM. If the job
runs for longer than the timeout specified using *-k*, then then the job exits
with a non-zero exit status.

If the job has KICKSTART_SETUP, KICKSTART_PREJOB, or KICKSTART_POSTJOB, then
their runtimes are included in the timeout and they will be sent SIGTERM/SIGKILL
in the same manner as the main job. If KICKSTART_CLEANUP is set, then it will run
regardless of whether processes from the other stages were signalled. If
KICKSTART_SETUP is specified, and it runs longer than the timeout, then it
will be signalled, and the other stages will be skipped.

Output Format
-------------
Refer to <https://pegasus.isi.edu/documentation/schemas/iv-2.2/iv-2.2.html>
for an up-to-date description of elements and their attributes. Check with
<https://pegasus.isi.edu/documentation> for invocation schemas with a higher 
version number.


Restrictions
------------
There is no version for the Condor 'standard' universe. It is simply not 
possible within the constraints of Condor. 

Due to its very nature, *pegasus-kickstart* will also prove difficult 
to port outside the Unix environment.

Any of the pre-, main-, cleanup and postjob are unable to influence one 
another's visible environment.

Do not use a Pegasus transformation with just the name 'null' 
and no namespace nor version.

First Condor, and then Unix, place a limit on the length of the command line. 
The additional space required for the gridstart invocation may silently 
overflow the maximum space, and cause applications to fail. If you suspect
to work with many argument, try an argument-file based approach.

A job failing with exit code 126 or 127 is indistinguishable from
*pegasus-kickstart* failing with the same exit codes. Sometimes, careful 
examination of the returned data can help.

If the logfile is collected into a shared file, due to the size of the
data, simultaneous appends on a shared filesystem from different
machines may still mangle data. Currently, file locking is not even
attempted, although all data is written atomically from the perspective
of *pegasus-kickstart*.

The upper limit of characters of command line characters is currently not 
checked by *pegasus-kickstart*. Thus, some variable substitutions could 
potentially result in a command line that is larger than permissible.

If the output or error file is opened in append mode, but the
application decides to truncate its output file, as in the above example
by opening '/dev/fd/1' inside 'keg', the resulting file will still be 
truncated. This is correct behavior, but sometimes not obvious.


Files
-----
*/usr/share/pegasus/schema/iv-2.2.xsd*::
is the suggested location of the latest XML schema describing the data
on the submit host.


[[METADATA]]
Metadata
--------
Kickstart creates a file to which the job should write metadata "key=value"
pairs. The contents of the file are inserted into the invocation record by
Kickstart, and transferred with the job's stdio. If the job is run under
Pegasus, then pegasus-monitord will parse this metadata and merge it with
the metadata for the job in the Pegasus workflow database. Kickstart uses
the environment variable *KICKSTART_METADATA* to tell the job to which file
it should write its metadata.


Environment Variables
---------------------
Note: Pegasus 4.6 deprecated the "GRIDSTART_" prefix for environment variables
and replaced it with "KICKSTART_". The "GRIDSTART_" versions of the old variables
should still work.

*KICKSTART_TMP*::
is the hightest priority to look for a temporary directory, if
specified. This rather special variable was introduced to overcome
some peculiarities with the FNAL cluster. 

*TMP*::
is the next hightest priority to look for a temporary directory, if
specified. 

*TEMP*::
is the next priority for an environment variable denoting a 
temporary files directory.

*TMPDIR*::
is next in the checklist. If none of these are found, either the
'stdio' definition 'P_tmpdir' is taken, or the fixed string
'/tmp'.

*KICKSTART_SETUP*::
contains a string that starts a job to be executed unconditionally
before any other jobs, see above for a detailed description.

*KICKSTART_PREJOB*::
contains a string that starts a job to be executed before the main
job, see above for a detailed description.

*KICKSTART_POSTJOB*::
contains a string that starts a job to be executed conditionally 
after the main job, see above for a detailed description.

*KICKSTART_CLEANUP*::
contains a string that starts a job to be executed unconditionally
after any of the previous jobs, see above for a detailed description.

*KICKSTART_PREPEND_PATH*::
the value of this variable is prepended to the PATH variable seen by
Kickstart and passed to the job. The modified PATH is also used to look
up executables for the main job and any pre/post/setup/cleanup jobs.

*KICKSTART_WRAPPER*::
the value of this variable is prepended to the job arguments. It can
be used to wrap the task with a wrapper or launcher. For example, you
can set it to "mpiexec -n 128" to run an MPI job, or you can set it
to "tau_exec" to profile the job with TAU.

*KICKSTART_TRACE_ALL*
If this variable is set, then the *-Z* option will trace everything,
including stdio and directories. By default, stdio and directories are
ignored.

*KICKSTART_TRACE_CWD*
If this variable is set, then the *-Z* option will only trace files in the
current working directory of the process.

*KICKSTART_TRACE_MATCH*::
If this variable is set, then the *-Z* option will only trace files that
match one of the patterns specified. The value of this variable should
be a list of *fnmatch()* patterns separated by ':'.

*KICKSTART_TRACE_IGNORE*
This is the inverse of *KICKSTART_TRACE_MATCH*. Any files matching one of the
patterns will be ignored, and all other files will be traced.

*KICKSTART_METADATA*
Kickstart passes this environment variable to the job. The value of the
variable is the path to the metadata file to which the job should write its
metadata. See the <<METADATA,*METADATA*>> section for more information.


History
-------
As you may have noticed, *pegasus-kickstart* had the name *kickstart*
in previous incantations. We are slowly moving to the new name to avoid
clashes in a larger OS installation setting. However, there is no
pertinent need to change the internal name, too, as no name clashes are
expected.
