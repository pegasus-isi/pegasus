Description
===========

**pegasus-integrity** either generates a file checksum (usually called
from **pegasus-kickstart**) or verifies a checksum for a file using
metadata in the current working directory (usually from PegasusLite).

Note that pegasus-integrity is a tool mostly used internally in Pegasus
workflows, but the tool can be used stand alone as well.
