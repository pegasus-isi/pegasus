Description
===========

**pegasus-exitcode** is a utility that examines the STDOUT of a job to
determine if the job failed, and renames the STDOUT and STDERR files of
a job to preserve them in case the job is retried.

Pegasus uses **pegasus-exitcode** as the DAGMan postscript for jobs
submitted via Globus GRAM. This tool exists as a workaround to a known
problem with Globus and Condor-G where the exitcodes of GRAM jobs are
not returned. This is a problem because Pegasus uses the exitcode of a
job to determine if the job failed or not.

In order to get around the exitcode problem, Pegasus can wrap GRAM jobs
with Kickstart, which records the exitcode of the job in an XML
invocation record, which it writes to the job’s STDOUT. The STDOUT is
transferred from the execution host back to the submit host when the job
terminates. After the job terminates, DAGMan runs the job’s postscript,
which Pegasus sets to be **pegasus-exitcode**. **pegasus-exitcode**
looks at the invocation record generated by kickstart to see if the job
succeeded or failed. If the invocation record indicates a failure, then
**pegasus-exitcode** returns a non-zero result, which indicates to
DAGMan that the job has failed. If the invocation record indicates that
the job succeeded, then **pegasus-exitcode** returns 0, which tells
DAGMan that the job succeeded.

In addition, clustered jobs executed with **pegasus-cluster** or
**pegasus-mpi-cluster** will have a ``[cluster-summary]`` record in
their STDOUT. **pegasus-exitcode** can examine these records to
determine if any of the tasks in the clustered job failed.

**pegasus-exitcode** performs several checks (some optional) to
determine whether a job failed or not. These checks include:

1. Is the Condor exitcode non-zero? If so, then the job failed.

2. Is STDOUT empty? If it is empty, then the job failed.

3. Are there any failure messages in the STDOUT or STDERR? If so, the
   job failed.

4. Are all of the success messages in the STDOUT or STDERR? If not, then
   the job failed.

5. Does the ``[cluster-summary]`` record indicate that the job was
   successful. If not, then the job failed.

6. Are there any ``<status>`` tags with a non-zero value? If there are,
   then the job failed. Note that, if this is a clustered job, there
   could be multiple ``<status>`` tags, one for each task. If any of
   them are non-zero, then the job failed.

7. Is there at least one ``<status>`` tag with a zero value? There must
   be at least one successful invocation or the job has failed.

In addition, **pegasus-exitcode** allows the caller to specify the
exitcode returned by Condor using the **--return** argument. This can be
passed to **pegasus-exitcode** in a DAGMan post script by using the
``$RETURN`` variable. If this value is non-zero, then
**pegasus-exitcode** returns a non-zero result before performing any
other checks. For GRAM jobs, the value of ``$RETURN`` will always be 0
regardless of whether the job failed or not.

In addition to checking the success/failure of a job,
**pegasus-exitcode** also renames the STDOUT and STDERR files of the job
so that if the job is retried, the STDOUT and STDERR of the previous run
are not lost. It does this by appending a sequence number to the end of
the files. For example, if the STDOUT file is called "job.out", then the
first time the job is run **pegasus-exitcode** will rename the file
"job.out.000". If the job is run again, then **pegasus-exitcode** sees
that "job.out.000" already exists and renames the file "job.out.001". It
will continue to rename the file by incrementing the sequence number
every time the job is executed.



Options
=======

**-h**; \ **--help**
   Prints a usage summary with all the available command-line options.

**-r** *rv*; \ **--return** *rv*
   Return value reported by DAGMan. This can be specified in the DAG
   using the $RETURN variable. If this is non-zero, then
   **pegasus-exitcode** immediately fails with a non-zero return value
   itself. If it is zero, then just rotate the file and don’t check for
   proper kickstart output. This option can be used in cases where
   kickstart cannot be used (such as pegasus-create-dir) to enable file
   rotation.

**-n**; \ **--no-rename**
   Don’t rename *job.out* and *job.err* to *.out.XXX* and *.err.XXX*.
   This option is used primarily for testing.

**-f** *msg*; \ **--failure-message** *msg*
   Failure message to find in job stdout/stderr. If this message exists
   in the stdout/stderr of the job, then the job will be considered a
   failure no matter what other output exists. If multiple failure
   messages are provided, then none of them can exist in the output or
   the job is considered a failure.

**-s** *msg*; \ **--success-message** *msg*
   Success message to find in job stdout/stderr. If this message does
   not exist in the stdout/stderr of the job, then the job will be
   considered a failure no matter what other output exists. If multiple
   success messages are provided, then they must all exist in the output
   or the job is considered a failure.

**-l** *filename*; \ **--log** *filename*
   Name of the common log file in which stdout/stderr will be
   redirected.
