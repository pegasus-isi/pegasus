   Abstract Workflow
   DAX
      The workflow input in YAML format given to Pegasus in which
      transformations and files are represented as logical names. It is an
      execution-independent specification of computations. The abstract
      workflow can optionally include catalog descriptions that tell
      Pegasus the location of the files (Replica Catalog), executables
      (Transformation Catalog) and the sites (Site Catalog).

   Concrete Workflow
   Executable Workflow
      The output workflow generated by Pegasus in which files are
      represented by physical filenames, transformations are represented by
      paths to executables, and sites or hosts have been selected
      for running each task. By default, Pegasus generates an executable
      workflow represented as a HTCondor DAGMan workflow.

   Compute Site
      The logical handle of the computational resource in the Site Catalog
      on which the executable workflow is executed by Pegasus.

   Clustering
      The process of grouping short running jobs together into a larger
      job. This is done to minimize the scheduling overhead for the jobs.
      The scheduling overhead is only incurred for the clustered job. For
      example if scheduling overhead is x seconds and 10 jobs are clustered
      into a larger job, the scheduling overhead for 10 jobs will be x
      instead of 10x.

   Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
      A graph in which all the arcs (connections) are unidirectional,linear,
      and without loops (cycles).

   Deferred Planning
      Planning mode to set up Pegasus. In this mode, instead of mapping the
      job at submit time, the decision of mapping a job to a site is
      deferred until a later point, i.e. when the job is about to be run.
      Deferred planning only applies to pegasusWorkflow jobs in the
      hierarchical workflows, where these jobs refer to another abstract
      workflow to be executed.

   Full Ahead Planning
      Planning mode to set up Pegasus. In this mode, all the jobs are
      mapped before submitting the workflow for execution to the underlying
      execution resources..

   Globus
      The Globus Alliance is a community of organizations and individuals
      developing fundamental technologies behind the "Grid," which lets
      people share computing power, databases, instruments, and other
      on-line tools securely across corporate, institutional, and
      geographic boundaries without sacrificing local autonomy.

      See Globus Toolkit

   Globus Toolkit
      Globus Toolkit is an open source software toolkit used for building
      Grid systems and applications.

   GRAM
      A Globus service that enables users to locate, submit, monitor and
      cancel remote jobs on Grid-based compute resources. It provides a
      single protocol for communicating with different batch/cluster job
      schedulers.

   Grid
      A collection of many compute resources , each under different
      administrative domains connected via a network (usually the
      Internet).

   GridFTP
      A high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer protocol optimized
      for high-bandwidth wide-area networks. It is based upon the Internet
      FTP protocol, and uses basic Grid security on both control (command)
      and data channels.

   Hierarchical Workflow
      A abstract workflow where some jobs in the
      workflow, instead of referring to compute jobs, point to another workflow
      that needs to be executed. Hierarchical workflows are one way for users
      to compose very large workflows that end up containing hundreds of
      thousands of tasks across all the sub workflows.

   HTCondor DAGMan
      The workflow execution engine used by Pegasus to manage the execution
      of the executable workflow.

   HTCondor-G
      A task broker that manages jobs to run at various distributed sites,
      using Globus GRAM to launch jobs on the remote
      sites. More information can be found at
      `HTCondor Website <https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor>`_

   Input Site
      The logical handle to the storage resource described in the Site Catalog,
      where input data required by a workflow resides.

   Kickstart
      A lightweight C executable that Pegasus uses to launch user executables to
      gather m

   Logical File Name (LFN)
      The unique logical identifier for a data file or an executable. Each LFN
      is associated with a set of PFN’s that are the physical instantiations
      of the file.

      See Physical File Name

   Metadata
      Any attributes of a dataset that are explicitly represented in the
      workflow system. These may include provenance information (e.g.,
      which component was used to generate the dataset), execution
      information (e.g., time of creation of the dataset), and properties
      of the dataset (e.g., density of a node type).

   Open Science Grid (OSG)
      The Open Science Grid consists of computing and storage elements at over
      100 individual sites spanning the United States. Researchers can submit
      batch jobs from their home institution - or OSG-provided submit points -
      in order to access their local resources and expand elastically out to
      the OSG, and leverage the distributed nature of our consortium. More
      information can be found at `OSG Website <https://opensciencegrid.org>`_

   Output Replica Catalog
      A catalog where the register jobs in the executable workflow
      record the locations of the generated outputs that are staged to the
      output site. By default, this is a sqlite database in the submit directory
      of the workflow.

   Output Site
      The logical handle to the data staging storage resource described
      in the Site Catalog, that identifies where the final outputs of the
      workflow are to be placed.

   Physical File Name (PFN)
      The physical filename (URL) of the LFN, that points to an actual file on a
      particular resource. The physical filename is usually associated with a "site"
      attribute in Pegasus catalogs, to tell Pegasus what site a file pointed to
      by a PFN resides on.

   Pegasus
      Pegasus is a workflow system, that takes in an abstract workflow and
      generates an executable workflow that can be executed on a set of
      distributed execution resources. It automatically locates the necessary
      input data and computational resources necessary for workflow execution.
      Pegasus allows workflow-based applications to execute in a number of
      different environments including desktops, campus clusters,
      computational grids, and clouds.

   Replica Catalog
      A catalog that maps LFNs on to PFNs.
      Pegasus uses this catalog to discover locations of datasets referred
      to in the abstract workflow.

   Site
      A set of compute resources under a single administrative domain.

   Staging Site
      The logical handle to the data staging storage resource described
      in the Site Catalog, which is used by Pegasus to stage input data
      required for jobs in the workflow, and store the intermediate
      datasets generated by the jobs in the workflow.

   Site Catalog
      A catalog indexed by logical site identifiers that maintains
      information about the various computational sites.

   Submit Directory
      The directory where Pegasus writes out the executable workflow.
      Usually, these are all the files required by HTCondor DAGMan to
      execute the executable workflow.

   Stampede Database
      The database where all the runtime provenance about the execution
      of the workflows is recorded. Pegasus Dashboard also pulls information
      from this database. By default, this is a sqlite database in the submit
      directory of the workflow.

   Sub Workflow
     The workflow referred to by a pegasusWorkflow job in a hierarchical
     workflow.

     See Hierarchical Workflow.

   Transformation
      Any executable or code that is run as a task in the workflow.

   Transformation Catalog
      A catalog that maps transformation names onto the physical pathnames
      of the transformation at a given compute site.

   XSEDE
     The Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) is a
     collection of supercomputing clusters and academic clouds largely available
     in the United States for use by researchers in various fields. More information
     can be found at `XSEDE Website <https://www.xsede.org/>`_
