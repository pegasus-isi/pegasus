========================
Submit Directory Details
========================

This chapter describes the submit directory content after Pegasus has
planned a workflow. Pegasus takes in an Abstract Workflow and
generates an executable workflow (DAG) in the submit directory.

This document also describes the various Replica Selection Strategies in
Pegasus.

.. _submit-directory-layout:

Layout
------

Each executable workflow is associated with a submit directory, and
includes the following:

#.  **<wflabel-wfindex>.dag**

    This is the Condor DAGMman dag file corresponding to the executable
    workflow generated by Pegasus. The dag file describes the edges in
    the DAG and information about the jobs in the DAG. Pegasus generated
    .dag file usually contains the following information for each job

    1. The job submit file for each job in the DAG.

    2. The post script that is to be invoked when a job completes. This
       is usually located at **$PEGASUS_HOME/bin/exitpost** and parses
       the kickstart record in the job's\ **.out file** and determines
       the exitcode.

    3. JOB RETRY - the number of times the job is to be retried in case
       of failure. In Pegasus, the job postscript exits with a non zero
       exitcode if it determines a failure occurred.

#.  **<wflabel-wfindex>.dag.dagman.out**

    When a DAG ( .dag file ) is executed by Condor DAGMan , the DAGMan
    writes out it's output to the **<daxlabel-wfindex>.dag.dagman.out
    file** . This file tells us the progress of the workflow, and can be
    used to determine the status of the workflow. Most of pegasus tools
    mine the **dagman.out** or **jobstate.log** to determine the
    progress of the workflows.

#.  **<wflabel-wfindex>.static.bp**

    This file contains netlogger events that link jobs in the DAG with
    the jobs in the Abstract Workflow. This file is parsed by
    *pegasus-monitord* when a workflow starts and populates to the
    stampede backend.

#. **<wflabel-wfindex>.stampede.db**

    This is the stampede backend (a sqlite database) to which
    *pegasus-monitord* populates all the runtime provenance information
    from workflow dagman.out and job .out and .err files.

#.  **<wflabel-wfindex>.replicas.db**

    This is the default output replica catalog (a sqlite database) to
    which the registration jobs populate output file locations and
    associated metadata.

#.  **<wflabel-wfindex>.replica.store**

    This is a file based replica catalog, that only lists file locations
    are mentioned in the Abstract Workflow in the Replica Catalog Section,
    and is written out by the planner at mapping time. This is used to pass
    locations of files mentioned in the parent workflow to a sub workflow
    in case of hierarchical workflows.

#.  **<wflabel-wfindex>.cache**

    This is a cache file generated by the planner that records where all
    the files in the workflow will be placed on the staging site, as the
    workflow executes. This is used in hierarchical workflows to pass
    locations of files in the parent workflow to when planner is invoked
    on the sub workflows.

#.  **<wflabel-wfindex>.cache.meta**

    This is a file populated by *pegasus-exitcode* to record the checksum
    information gleamed from parsing the kickstart output present in the
    job.out.\* files.  This is used in hierarchical workflows to pass
    checksum information of files in the parent workflow to when planner
    is invoked on the sub workflows.

#.  **<wflabel-wfindex>.metadata**

    This is a worflow level metadata json formatted file that is written
    out by the planner at mapping time, and lists all metadata for
    workflow, jobs and files specified in the Abstract Workflow.

#. **<wflabel-wfindex>.metrics**

    This is a json formatted file generated by the planner, that includes
    some planning metrics and workflow level metrics such as different
    type of jobs and files.

#.  **<wflabel-wfindex>.notify**

    This file contains all the notifications that need to be set for the
    workflow and the jobs in the executable workflow. The format of
    notify file is described :ref:`here <pegasus-notify-file>` .

#.  **<wflabel-wfindex>.dot**

    Pegasus creates a dot file for the executable workflow in addition
    to the .dag file. This can be used to visualize the executable
    workflow using the dot program.

#. **jobstate.log**

    The jobstate.log file is written out by the pegasus-monitord daemon
    that is launched when a workflow is submitted for execution by
    pegasus-run. The pegasus-monitord daemon parses the dagman.out file
    and writes out the jobstate.log that is easier to parse. The
    jobstate.log captures the various states through which a job goes
    during the workflow. There are other monitoring related files that
    are explained in the monitoring `chapter <#monitoring-files>`__.

#. **braindump.yml**

    Contains information about pegasus version, dax file, dag file, dax
    label.

#.  **<job>.sub**

    Each job in the executable workflow is associated with it's own
    submit file. The submit file tells Condor how to execute the job.

#.  **<job>.out.00n**

    The stdout of the executable referred in the job submit file. In
    Pegasus, most jobs are launched via kickstart. Hence, this file
    contains the kickstart XML provenance record that captures runtime
    provenance on the remote node where the job was executed. n varies
    from 1-N where N is the JOB RETRY value in the .dag file. The
    exitpost executable is invoked on the <job>.out file and it moves
    the <job>.out to <job>.out.00n so that the the job's .out files are
    preserved across retries.

#.  **<job>.err.00n**

    The stderr of the executable referred in the job submit file. In
    case of Pegasus, mostly the jobs are launched via kickstart. Hence,
    this file contains stderr of kickstart. This is usually empty unless
    there in an error in kickstart e.g. kickstart segfaults , or
    kickstart location specified in the submit file is incorrect. The
    exitpost executable is invoked on the **<job>.out** file and it
    moves the **<job>.err to <job>.err.00n** so that the the job's
    **.out** files are preserved across retries.

#.  **<job>.meta**

    This is a file created at runtime when *pegasus-exitcode* parses
    the kickstart output in the job.out file. This file records
    metadata and checksum information for output files created by
    the job and recorded by *pegasus-kickstart*.

.. _condor-dagman-file:

HTCondor DAGMan File
--------------------

The Condor DAGMan file ( .dag ) is the input to Condor DAGMan ( the
workflow executor used by Pegasus ) .

Pegasus generated .dag file usually contains the following information
for each job:

1. The job submit file for each job in the DAG.

2. The post script that is to be invoked when a job completes. This is
   usually found in **$PEGASUS_HOME/bin/exitpost** and parses the
   kickstart record in the job's .out file and determines the exitcode.

3. JOB RETRY - the number of times the job is to be retried in case of
   failure. In case of Pegasus, job postscript exits with a non zero
   exitcode if it determines a failure occurred.

4. The pre script to be invoked before running a job. This is usually
   for the dax jobs in the DAX. The pre script is pegasus-plan
   invocation for the subdax.

In the last section of the DAG file the relations between the jobs (
that identify the underlying DAG structure ) are highlighted.

.. _kickstart-xml-record:

Kickstart XML Record
--------------------

Kickstart is a light weight C executable that is shipped with the
pegasus worker package. All jobs are launced via Kickstart on the remote
end, unless explicitly disabled at the time of running pegasus-plan.

Kickstart does not work with:

1. Condor Standard Universe Jobs

2. MPI Jobs

Pegasus automatically disables kickstart for the above jobs.

Kickstart captures useful runtime provenance information about the job
launched by it on the remote note, and puts in an XML record that it
writes to its own stdout. The stdout appears in the workflow submit
directory as <job>.out.00n . The following information is captured by
kickstart and logged:

1. The exitcode with which the job it launched exited.

2. The duration of the job

3. The start time for the job

4. The node on which the job ran

5. The stdout and stderr of the job

6. The arguments with which it launched the job

7. The environment that was set for the job before it was launched.

8. The machine information about the node that the job ran on

Amongst the above information, the dagman.out file gives a coarser
grained estimate of the job duration and start time.

Reading a Kickstart Output File
-------------------------------

The kickstart file below has the following fields highlighted:

1. The host on which the job executed and the ipaddress of that host

2. The duration and start time of the job. The time here is in reference
   to the clock on the remote node where the job is executed.

3. The exitcode with which the job executed

4. The arguments with which the job was launched.

5. The directory in which the job executed on the remote site

6. The stdout of the job

7. The stderr of the job

8. The environment of the job

.. _jobstate-log-file:

Jobstate.Log File
-----------------

The jobstate.log file logs the various states that a job goes through
during workflow execution. It is created by the **pegasus-monitord**
daemon that is launched when a workflow is submitted to Condor DAGMan by
pegasus-run. **pegasus-monitord** parses the dagman.out file and writes
out the jobstate.log file, the format of which is more amenable to
parsing.

.. note::

   The jobstate.log file is not created if a user uses condor_submit_dag
   to submit a workflow to Condor DAGMan.

The jobstate.log file can be created after a workflow has finished
executing by running **pegasus-monitord** on the .dagman.out file in the
workflow submit directory.

Below is a snippet from the jobstate.log for a single job executed via
condorg:

Each entry in jobstate.log has the following:

1. The ISO timestamp for the time at which the particular event
   happened.

2. The name of the job.

3. The event recorded by DAGMan for the job.

4. The condor id of the job in the queue on the submit node.

5. The pegasus site to which the job is mapped.

6. The job time requirements from the submit file.

7. The job submit sequence for this workflow.

   **STATE/EVENT**                            **DESCRIPTION**
   SUBMIT                                     job is submitted by condor schedd for execution.
   EXECUTE                                    condor schedd detects that a job has started execution.
   GLOBUS_SUBMIT                              the job has been submitted to the remote resource. It's only written for GRAM jobs (i.e. gt2 and gt4).
   GRID_SUBMIT                                same as GLOBUS_SUBMIT event. The ULOG_GRID_SUBMIT event is written for all grid universe jobs./
   JOB_TERMINATED                             job terminated on the remote node.
   JOB_SUCCESS                                job succeeded on the remote host, condor id will be zero (successful exit code).
   JOB_FAILURE                                job failed on the remote host, condor id will be the job's exit code.
   POST_SCRIPT_STARTED                        post script started by DAGMan on the submit host, usually to parse the kickstart output
   POST_SCRIPT_TERMINATED                     post script finished on the submit node.
   POST_SCRIPT_SUCCESS \| POST_SCRIPT_FAILURE post script succeeded or failed.

Pegasus Workflow Job States and Delays
--------------------------------------

The various job states that a job goes through ( as caputured in the
dagman.out and jobstate.log file) during it's lifecycle are illustrated
below. The figure below highlights the various local and remote delays
during job lifecycle.

.. _braindump-file:

Braindump File
--------------

The braindump file is created per workflow in the submit file and
contains metadata about the workflow.

.. _static-bp-file:

Pegasus static.bp File
----------------------

Pegasus creates a workflow.static.bp file that links jobs in the DAG
with the jobs in the DAX. The contents of the file are in netlogger
format. The purpose of this file is to be able to link an invocation
record of a task to the corresponding job in the DAX

The workflow is replaced by the name of the workflow i.e. same prefix as
the .dag file

In the file there are five types of events:

-  task.info

   This event is used to capture information about all the tasks in the
   DAX( abstract workflow)

-  task.edge

   This event is used to capture information about the edges between the
   tasks in the DAX ( abstract workflow )

-  job.info

   This event is used to capture information about the jobs in the DAG (
   executable workflow generated by Pegasus )

-  job.edge

   This event is used to capture information about edges between the
   jobs in the DAG ( executable workflow ).

-  wf.map.task_job

   This event is used to associate the tasks in the DAX with the
   corresponding jobs in the DAG.
