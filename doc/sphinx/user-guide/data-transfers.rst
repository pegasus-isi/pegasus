==============
Data Transfers
==============

As part of the Workflow Mapping Process, Pegasus does data management
for the executable workflow . It queries a Replica Catalog to discover
the locations of the input datasets and adds data movement and
registration nodes in the workflow to

1. stage-in input data to the staging sites ( a site associated with the
   compute job to be used for staging. In the shared filesystem setup,
   staging site is the same as the execution sites where the jobs in the
   workflow are executed )

2. stage-out output data generated by the workflow to the final storage
   sites.

3. stage-in intermediate data between compute sites if required.

4. data registration nodes to catalog the locations of the output data
   on the final storage sites into the replica catalog.

The separate data movement jobs that are added to the executable
workflow are responsible for staging data to a workflow specific
directory accessible to the staging server on a staging site associated
with the compute sites. Depending on the data staging configuration, the
staging site for a compute site is the compute site itself. In the
default case, the staging server is usually on the headnode of the
compute site and has access to the shared filesystem between the worker
nodes and the head node. Pegasus adds a directory creation job in the
executable workflow that creates the workflow specific directory on the
staging server.

In addition to data, Pegasus will transfer user executables to the
compute sites if the executables are not installed on the remote sites
before hand. This chapter gives an overview of how the transfers of data
and executables are managed in Pegasus.

Pegasus picks up files for data transfers based on the transfer
attribute associated with the input and output files for the job. These
are designated in the Abstract Workflow as uses elements in the job element.
If not specified, the transfer flag defaults to true. So if you don't want all
the generated files to be transferred to the output sites, you need to
explicitly set the stage_out flag to false for the file.

.. _ref-data-staging-configuration:

Data Staging Configuration
--------------------------

Pegasus can be broadly setup to run workflows in the following
configurations

-  **Condor Pool Without a shared filesystem**

   This setup applies to a condor pool where the worker nodes making up
   a condor pool don't share a filesystem. All data IO is achieved using
   Condor File IO. This is a special case of the non shared filesystem
   setup, where instead of using pegasus-transfer to transfer input and
   output data, Condor File IO is used. This is the **default** data
   staging configuration in Pegasus.

-  **NonShared FileSystem**

   This setup applies to where the head node and the worker nodes of a
   cluster don't share a filesystem. Compute jobs in the workflow run in
   a local directory on the worker node

-  **Shared File System**

   This setup applies to where the head node and the worker nodes of a
   cluster share a filesystem. Compute jobs in the workflow run in a
   directory on the shared filesystem.

.. note::

   The default data staging configuration was changed from **sharedfs**
   (Shared File System) to **condorio** (Condor Pool Without a shared
   filesystem) starting with **Pegasus 5.0 release**.

For the purposes of data configuration various sites, and directories
are defined below.

1. **Submit Host**

   The host from where the workflows are submitted . This is where
   Pegasus and Condor DAGMan are installed. This is referred to as the
   **"local"** site in the site catalog .

2. **Compute Site**

   The site where the jobs mentioned in the Abstract Workflow are executed. There
   needs to be an entry in the Site Catalog for every compute site. The
   compute site is passed to pegasus-plan using **--sites** option

3. **Staging Site**

   A site to which the separate transfer jobs in the executable workflow
   ( jobs with stage_in , stage_out and stage_inter prefixes that
   Pegasus adds using the transfer refiners) stage the input data to and
   the output data from to transfer to the final output site. Currently,
   the staging site is always the compute site where the jobs execute.

4. **Output Site**

   The output site is the final storage site where the users want the
   output data from jobs to go to. The output site is passed to
   pegasus-plan using the **--output** option. The stageout jobs in the
   workflow stage the data from the staging site to the final storage
   site.

5. **Input Site**

   The site where the input data is stored. The locations of the input
   data are catalogued in the Replica Catalog, and the *"site"*
   attribute of the locations gives us the site handle for the input
   site.

6. **Workflow Execution Directory**

   This is the directory created by the create dir jobs in the
   executable workflow on the Staging Site. This is a directory per
   workflow per staging site. Currently, the Staging site is always the
   Compute Site.

7. **Worker Node Directory**

   This is the directory created on the worker nodes per job usually by
   the job wrapper that launches the job.

.. _ref-data-staging-condorio:

Condor Pool Without a Shared Filesystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Pegasus is setup to do your data transfers in this mode.
This setup applies to a condor pool where the worker nodes making up a
condor pool don't share a filesystem. All data IO is achieved using
Condor File IO. This is a special case of the non shared filesystem
setup, where instead of using pegasus-transfer to transfer input and
output data, Condor File IO is used.

**Setup**

-  Submit Host and staging site are same

-  head node and worker nodes of compute site don't share a filesystem

-  Input Data is staged from remote sites.

-  Remote Output Site i.e site other than compute site. Can be submit
   host.

.. figure:: ../images/data-configuration-condorio.png
   :alt: Condor Pool Without a Shared Filesystem

   Condor Pool Without a Shared Filesystem

The data flow is as follows in this case

1. Stagein Job executes on the submit host to stage in input data from
   Input Sites ( 1---n) to a workflow specific execution directory on
   the submit host

2. Compute Job starts on a worker node in a local execution directory.
   Before the compute job starts, Condor transfers the input data for
   the job from the workflow execution directory on thesubmit host to
   the local execution directory on the worker node.

3. The compute job executes in the worker node, and executes on the
   worker node.

4. The compute Job writes out output data to the local directory on the
   worker node using Posix IO

5. When the compute job finishes, Condor transfers the output data for
   the job from the local execution directory on the worker node to the
   workflow execution directory on the submit host.

6. Stageout Job executes ( either on Submit Host or staging site ) to
   stage out output data from the workflow specific execution directory
   to a directory on the final output site.

In this case, the compute jobs are wrapped as
:ref:`PegasusLite <pegasuslite>` instances.

This mode is especially useful for running in the cloud environments
where you don't want to setup a shared filesystem between the worker
nodes. Running in that mode is explained in detail
:ref:`here. <amazon-aws>`

.. tip::

   Set **pegasus.data.configuration** to **condorio** to run in this
   configuration. In this mode, the staging site is automatically set to
   site **local**

In this setup, Pegasus always stages the input files through the submit
host i.e the stage-in job stages in data from the input site to the
submit host (local site). The input data is then transferred to remote
worker nodes from the submit host using Condor file transfers. In the
case, where the input data is locally accessible at the submit host i.e
the input site and the submit host are the same, then it is possible to
bypass the creation of separate stage in jobs that copy the data to the
workflow specific directory on the submit host. Instead, Condor file
transfers can be setup to transfer the input files directly from the
locally accessible input locations ( file URL's with "*site*" attribute
set to local) specified in the replica catalog. More details can be
found at :ref:`bypass-input-staging`.

In some cases, it might be useful to setup the PegasusLite jobs to
pull input data directly from the input site without going through the
staging server.


.. _ref-data-staging-nonsharedfs:

Non Shared Filesystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this setup , Pegasus runs workflows on local file-systems of worker
nodes with the the worker nodes not sharing a filesystem. The data
transfers happen between the worker node and a staging / data
coordination site. The staging site server can be a file server on the
head node of a cluster or can be on a separate machine.

**Setup**

-  compute and staging site are the different

-  head node and worker nodes of compute site don't share a filesystem

-  Input Data is staged from remote sites.

-  Remote Output Site i.e site other than compute site. Can be submit
   host.

.. figure:: ../images/data-configuration-nonsharedfs.png
   :alt: Non Shared Filesystem Setup

   Non Shared Filesystem Setup

The data flow is as follows in this case

1. Stagein Job executes ( either on Submit Host or on staging site ) to
   stage in input data from Input Sites ( 1---n) to a workflow specific
   execution directory on the staging site.

2. Compute Job starts on a worker node in a local execution directory.
   Accesses the input data using pegasus transfer to transfer the data
   from the staging site to a local directory on the worker node

3. The compute job executes in the worker node, and executes on the
   worker node.

4. The compute Job writes out output data to the local directory on the
   worker node using Posix IO

5. Output Data is pushed out to the staging site from the worker node
   using pegasus-transfer.

6. Stageout Job executes ( either on Submit Host or staging site ) to
   stage out output data from the workflow specific execution directory
   to a directory on the final output site.

In this case, the compute jobs are wrapped as
:ref:`PegasusLite <pegasuslite>` instances.

This mode is especially useful for running in the cloud environments
where you don't want to setup a shared filesystem between the worker
nodes. Running in that mode is explained in detail
:ref:`here. <amazon-aws>`

.. tip::

   Set  **pegasus.data.configuration** to **nonsharedfs** to run in this
   configuration. The staging site can be specified using the
   **--staging-site** option to pegasus-plan.

In this setup, Pegasus always stages the input files through the staging
site i.e the stage-in job stages in data from the input site to the
staging site. The PegasusLite jobs that start up on the worker nodes,
then pull the input data from the staging site for each job. In some
cases, it might be useful to setup the PegasusLite jobs to pull input
data directly from the input site without going through the staging
server. More details can be found at :ref:`bypass-input-staging`.



.. _ref-data-staging-sharedfs:

Shared File System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this setup, Pegasus runs workflows in the shared file system
setup, where the worker nodes and the head node of a cluster share a
filesystem.

.. figure:: ../images/data-configuration-sharedfs.png
   :alt: Shared File System Setup

   Shared File System Setup

The data flow is as follows in this case

1. Stagein Job executes ( either on Submit Host or Head Node ) to stage
   in input data from Input Sites ( 1---n) to a workflow specific
   execution directory on the shared filesystem.

2. Compute Job starts on a worker node in the workflow execution
   directory. Accesses the input data using Posix IO

3. Compute Job executes on the worker node and writes out output data to
   workflow execution directory using Posix IO

4. Stageout Job executes ( either on Submit Host or Head Node ) to stage
   out output data from the workflow specific execution directory to a
   directory on the final output site.

..

.. tip::

   Set **pegasus.data.configuration** to **sharedfs** to run in this
   configuration.

.. _ref-data-staging-nonsharedfs-shared:

Hybrid Shared Filesystem with Non Shared Filesystem semantics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When executing your workflow in shared filesystem mode, the compute jobs
are launched directly using *pegasus-kickstart*. The are not wrapped further
in a PegasusLite wrapper invocation, that allows users to execute the jobs
on the worker node filesystem (as in the nonsharedfs and condorio mode).
The PegasusLite wrapper also enables integrity checking and allows jobs to
be launched via application containers. If running in shared filesystem mode,
and you want to leverage these features, you can opt to designate the
staging site for your compute site to be the shared filesystem on the compute
site itself.

To do is you need to

1) Set **pegasus.data.configuration** to **nonsharedfs** .

2) For your compute site with a shared filesystem, add the shared-scratch
   directory that points to a directory on the shared filesystem of the
   cluster.

3) To prevent a copy of the inputs from the shared filesystem directory
   where the Pegasus data stagein jobs place data for the workflow, to
   the local directory on the local worker nodes, you can enable symlinking
   by setting **pegasus.transfer.links** to **true**. In this case, in the
   PegasusLite jobs the input data will be symlinked from the directory on
   the shared filesystem, and the outputs will be file copied from the local
   directory on the worker node, back to the shared filesystem directory.
   Also when jobs are launched via application containers, Pegasus will ensure
   that the shared filesystem directory is mounted into the container.



.. _local-vs-remote-transfers:

Local versus Remote Transfers
-----------------------------

As far as possible, Pegasus will ensure that the transfer jobs added to
the executable workflow are executed on the submit host. By default,
Pegasus will schedule a transfer to be executed on the remote staging
site only if there is no way to execute it on the submit host. Some
scenarios where transfer jobs are executed on remote sites are as
follows:

-  the file server specified for the staging site/compute site is a file
   server. In that case, Pegasus will schedule all the stage in data
   movement jobs on the compute site to stage-in the input data for the
   workflow.

-  a user has symlinking turned on. In that case, the transfer jobs that
   symlink against the input data on the compute site, will be executed
   remotely ( on the compute site ).

In certain execution environments, such a local campus cluster the
compute site and the local share a filesystem ( i.e. compute site has
file servers specified for the staging/compute site, and the scratch and
storage directories mentioned for the compute site are locally mounted
on the submit host), it is beneficial to have the remote transfer jobs
run locally and hence bypass going through the local scheduler queue. In
that case, users can set a boolean profile auxillary.local in pegasus
namespace in the site catalog for the compute/staging site to true.

Users can specify the property **pegasus.transfer.*.remote.sites** to
change the default behaviour of Pegasus and force pegasus to run
different types of transfer jobs for the sites specified on the remote
site. The value of the property is a comma separated list of compute
sites for which you want the transfer jobs to run remotely.

The table below illustrates all the possible variations of the property.

.. table:: Property Variations for pegasus.transfer.*.remote.sites

   ====================================== ============================
   Property Name                          Applies to
   ====================================== ============================
   pegasus.transfer.stagein.remote.sites  the stage in transfer jobs
   pegasus.transfer.stageout.remote.sites the stage out transfer jobs
   pegasus.transfer.inter.remote.sites    the inter site transfer jobs
   pegasus.transfer.*.remote.sites        all types of transfer jobs
   ====================================== ============================

The prefix for the transfer job name indicates whether the transfer job
is to be executed locallly ( on the submit host ) or remotely ( on the
compute site ). For example stage_in_local\_ in a transfer job name
stage_in_local_isi_viz_0 indicates that the transfer job is a stage in
transfer job that is executed locally and is used to transfer input data
to compute site isi_viz. The prefix naming scheme for the transfer jobs
is **[stage_in|stage_out|inter]_[local|remote]\_** .

.. _controlling-transfer-parallelism:

Controlling Transfer Parallelism
--------------------------------

When it comes to data transfers, Pegasus ships with a default
configuration which is trying to strike a balance between performance
and aggressiveness. We obviously want data transfers to be as quick as
possibly, but we also do not want our transfers to overwhelm data
services and systems.

Pegasus adds
transfer jobs and cleanup jobs based on the number of jobs at a
particular level of the workflow. For example, for every 10 compute jobs
on a level of a workflow, one data transfer job( stage-in and stage-out)
is created. The default configuration also sets how many threads such a
pegasus-transfer job can spawn. Cleanup jobs are similarly constructed
with an internal ratio of 5.

Information on how to control the number of stagein and stageout jobs
can be found in the `Data Movement Nodes <#data-movement-nodes>`__
section.

How to control the number of threads pegasus-transfer can use depends on
if you want to control standard transfer jobs, or PegasusLite. For the
former, see the :ref:`pegasus.transfer.threads <transfer-props>` property,
and for the latter the
:ref:`pegasus.transfer.lite.threads <transfer-props>` property.

.. _transfer-symlink:

Symlinking Against Input Data
-----------------------------

If input data for a job already exists on a compute site, then it is
possible for Pegasus to symlink against that data. In this case, the
remote stage in transfer jobs that Pegasus adds to the executable
workflow will symlink instead of doing a copy of the data.

Pegasus determines whether a file is on the same site as the compute
site, by inspecting the *"site*" attribute associated with the URL in
the Replica Catalog. If the *"site"* attribute of an input file location
matches the compute site where the job is scheduled, then that
particular input file is a candidate for symlinking.

For Pegasus to symlink against existing input data on a compute site,
following must be true

1. Property **pegasus.transfer.links** is set to **true**

2. The input file location in the Replica Catalog has the *"site"*
   attribute matching the compute site.

..

.. tip::

   To confirm if a particular input file is symlinked instead of being
   copied, look for the destination URL for that file in
   stage_in_remote*.in file. The destination URL will start with
   symlink:// .

In the symlinking case, Pegasus strips out URL prefix from a URL and
replaces it with a file URL.

For example if a user has the following URL catalogued in the Replica
Catalog for an input file f.input

::

   f.input   gsiftp://server.isi.edu/shared/storage/input/data/f.input site="isi"

and the compute job that requires this file executes on a compute site
named isi , then if symlinking is turned on the data stage in job
(stage_in_remote_viz_0 ) will have the following source and destination
specified for the file

::

   #viz viz
   file:///shared/storage/input/data/f.input  symlink://shared-scratch/workflow-exec-dir/f.input

Symlinking in Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also when jobs are launched via application containers, Pegasus does support
symbolic linking of input data sets from directories visible on the host
filesystem. More details can be found :ref:`here <containers-symlinking>`.


.. _data-movement-nodes:

Addition of Separate Data Movement Nodes to Executable Workflow
---------------------------------------------------------------

Pegasus relies on a Transfer Refiner that comes up with the strategy on
how many data movement nodes are added to the executable workflow. All
the compute jobs scheduled to a site share the same workflow specific
directory. The transfer refiners ensure that only one copy of the input
data is transferred to the workflow execution directory. This is to
prevent data clobbering . Data clobbering can occur when compute jobs of
a workflow share some input files, and have different stage in transfer
jobs associated with them that are staging the shared files to the same
destination workflow execution directory.

Pegasus supports three different transfer refiners that dictate how the
stagein and stageout jobs are added for the workflow.The default
Transfer Refiner used in Pegasus is the BalancedCluster Refiner.
Starting 4.8.0 release, the default configuration of Pegasus now adds
transfer jobs and cleanup jobs based on the number of jobs at a
particular level of the workflow. For example, for every 10 compute jobs
on a level of a workflow, one data transfer job( stage-in and stage-out)
is created.

The transfer refiners also allow the user to specify how many
local|remote stagein|stageout jobs are created per execution site.

The behavior of the refiners (BalancedCluster and Cluster) are
controlled by specifying certain pegasus profiles

1. either with the execution sites in the site catalog

2. OR globally in the properties file

.. table:: Pegasus Profile Keys For the Cluster Transfer Refiner

   ======================== =================================================================================================================================================================================
   Profile Key              Description
   ======================== =================================================================================================================================================================================
   stagein.clusters         This key determines the maximum number of stage-in jobs that are can executed locally or remotely per compute site per workflow.
   stagein.local.clusters   This key provides finer grained control in determining the number of stage-in jobs that are executed locally and are responsible for staging data to a particular remote site.
   stagein.remote.clusters  This key provides finer grained control in determining the number of stage-in jobs that are executed remotely on the remote site and are responsible for staging data to it.
   stageout.clusters        This key determines the maximum number of stage-out jobs that are can executed locally or remotely per compute site per workflow.
   stageout.local.clusters  This key provides finer grained control in determining the number of stage-out jobs that are executed locally and are responsible for staging data from a particular remote site.
   stageout.remote.clusters This key provides finer grained control in determining the number of stage-out jobs that are executed remotely on the remote site and are responsible for staging data from it.
   ======================== =================================================================================================================================================================================

..

.. tip::

   Which transfer refiner to use is controlled by property
   pegasus.transfer.refiner

.. _transfer-refiner-balanced-cluster:

BalancedCluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a new transfer refiner that was introduced in Pegasus 4.4.0 and
is the default one used in Pegasus. It does a round robin distribution
of the files amongst the stagein and stageout jobs per level of the
workflow. The figure below illustrates the behavior of this transfer
refiner.

.. figure:: ../images/balanced-cluster-transfer-refiner.png
   :alt: BalancedCluster Transfer Refiner : Input Data To Workflow Specific Directory on Shared File System

Cluster
~~~~~~~

This transfer refiner is similar to BalancedCluster but differs in the
way how distribution of files happen across stagein and stageout jobs
per level of the workflow. In this refiner, all the input files for a
job get associated with a single transfer job. As illustrated in the
figure below each compute usually gets associated with one stagein
transfer job. In contrast, for the BalancedCluster a compute job maybe
associated with multiple data stagein jobs.

.. figure:: ../images/cluster-transfer-refiner.png
   :alt: Cluster Transfer Refiner : Input Data To Workflow Specific Directory on Shared File System

Basic
~~~~~

Pegasus also supports a basic Transfer Refiner that adds one stagein and
stageout job per compute job of the workflow. This is not recommended to
be used for large workflows as the number of data transfer nodes in the
worst case are 2n where n is the number of compute jobs in the workflow.

Staging of Executables
----------------------

Users can get Pegasus to stage the user executable ( executable that the
jobs in the Abstract Workflow refer to ) as part of the transfer jobs to the workflow
specific execution directory on the compute site. The URL locations of
the executable need to be specified in the transformation catalog as the
PFN and the type of executable needs to be set to **STAGEABLE** .

The location of a transformation can be specified either in

-  Abstract Workflow in the executable section. More details
   :ref:`here <dax-transformation-catalog>` .

-  Transformation Catalog. More details :ref:`here <transformation>` .

A particular transformation catalog entry of type STAGEABLE is
compatible with a compute site only if all the System Information
attributes associated with the entry match with the System Information
attributes for the compute site in the Site Catalog. The following
attributes make up the System Information attributes

1. arch

2. os

3. osrelease

4. osversion

Transformation Mappers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pegasus has a notion of transformation mappers that determines what type
of executable are picked up when a job is executed on a remote compute
site. For transfer of executable, Pegasus constructs a soft state map
that resides on top of the transformation catalog, that helps in
determining the locations from where an executable can be staged to the
remote site.

Users can specify the following property to pick up a specific
transformation mapper

::

   pegasus.catalog.transformation.mapper

Currently, the following transformation mappers are supported.

.. table:: Transformation Mappers Supported in Pegasus

   ===================== ======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
   Transformation Mapper Description
   ===================== ======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
   Installed             This mapper only relies on transformation catalog entries that are of type INSTALLED to construct the soft state map. This results in Pegasus never doing any transfer of executable as part of the workflow. It always prefers the installed executable at the remote sites
   Staged                This mapper only relies on matching transformation catalog entries that are of type STAGEABLE to construct the soft state map. This results in the executable workflow referring only to the staged executable, irrespective of the fact that the executable are already installed at the remote end
   All                   This mapper relies on all matching transformation catalog entries of type STAGEABLE or INSTALLED for a particular transformation as valid sources for the transfer of executable. This the most general mode, and results in the constructing the map as a result of the cartesian product of the matches.
   Submit                This mapper only on matching transformation catalog entries that are of type STAGEABLE and reside at the submit host (site local), are used while constructing the soft state map. This is especially helpful, when the user wants to use the latest compute code for his computations on the grid and that relies on his submit host.
   ===================== ======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

.. _transfer-worker-package_staging:

Staging of Worker Package
-------------------------

The worker package contains runtime tools such as *pegasus-kickstart*
and *pegasus-transfer*, and is required to be available for most jobs.

How the package is made available to the jobs depends on multiple
factors. For example, a pre-installed Pegasus can be used if the
location is set using the environment profile PEGASUS_HOME for the site
in the Site Catalog.

If Pegasus is not already available on the execution site, the worker
package can be staged by setting the following property:

::

   pegasus.transfer.worker.package          true

Note that how the package is transferred and accessed differs based on
the configured data management mode:

-  *sharedfs* mode: the package is staged in to the shared filesystem
   once, and reused for all the jobs

-  *nonsharedfs* or *condorio* mode: each job carries a worker package.
   This is obviously less efficient, but the size of the worker package
   is kept small to minimize the impact of these extra transfers.

Which worker package is used is determined in the following order:

-  There is an entry for pegasus::worker executable in the
   transformation catalog. Information on how to construct that entry is
   provided below.

-  The planner at runtime creates a worker package out of the binary
   installation, and puts it in the submit directory. This worker
   package is used if the OS and architecture of the created worker
   package match with remote site, or there is an exact match with
   (osrelease and osversion) if specified by the user in the site
   catalog for the remote site.

-  The worker package compatible with the remote site is available as a
   binary from the Pegasus download site.

-  At runtime, in the *nonsharedfs* or *condorio* modes, extra checks
   are made to make sure the worker package matches the Pegasus version
   and the OS and architecture. The reason is that these workflows might
   be running in an heterogeneous environment, and thus there is no way
   to know before the job starts what worker package is required. If the
   runtime check fails, a worker package matching the Pegasus version,
   OS and architecture will be downloaded from the Pegasus download
   site. This behavior can be controlled with the
   :ref:`pegasus.transfer.worker.package.autodownload <transfer-props>`
   and
   :ref:`pegasus.transfer.worker.package.strict <transfer-props>`
   properties.

If you want to specify a particular worker package to use, you can
specify the transformation **pegasus::worker** in the transformation
catalog with:

-  type set to STAGEABLE

-  System Information attributes of the transformation catalog entry
   match the System Information attributes of the compute site.

-  the PFN specified should be a remote URL that can be pulled to the
   compute site.

.. _staging-job-checkpoint-files:

Staging of Job Checkpoint Files
-------------------------------

Pegasus has support for transferring job checkpoint files back to the
staging site when a job exceeds its advertised running time. This can be done
by marking file(s) as checkpoint(s) using one of the workflow APIs. The following
describes how to do this, using the :ref:`api-python` API, for two different application scenarios:

1. **The application regularly updates/overwrites a fixed number of checkpoint files.** 

.. code-block:: python

   job = Job(exe)\
         .add_checkpoint(File("saved_state_a.txt"))\
         .add_checkpoint(File("saved_state_b.txt"))\
         .add_profiles(Namespace.PEGASUS, key="maxwalltime", value=2)


2. **The application needs a signal to begin writing a checkpoint file.** In this
   scenario, a ``SIGTERM`` will be sent by **pegasus-kickstart** to the running
   executable at time ``checkpoint.time`` minutes. The executable should then handle
   the ``SIGTERM`` by starting to write out a checkpoint file. At time 
   ``(checkpoint.time + (maxwalltime-checkpoint.time)/2)``, a ``KILL`` signal
   will be sent to the job. The given formula is used to allow the application
   time to write the checkpoint file and have it staged out.

.. code-block:: python

   # SIGTERM will be sent at time = 1 minute
   # KILL will be sent at time = (1 + (2 - 1)/2) = 1.5 minutes

   job = Job(exe)\
         .add_checkpoint(File("saved_state.txt"))\
         .add_profiles(Namespace.PEGASUS, key="checkpoint.time", value=1)\
         .add_profiles(Namespace.PEGASUS, key="maxwalltime", value=2)

.. note::

   When using the ``condorio`` data staging configuration, an empty checkpoint
   file (placeholder) must be created and referenced in the replica catalog prior to submitting
   the workflow. 


.. caution::

   - ``dagman.retry`` should be large enough to allow the job to run until completion
   - ``maxwalltime`` should be large enough to allow the job to write a checkpoint file at least once

.. _bypass-input-staging:

Bypass Input File Staging
-------------------------
When executing a workflow in PegasusLite mode (i.e the data configuration is
either condorio (default) or bypass), then it is possible to bypass the
placement of the raw input data required by the workflow on to the staging
site. Instead the PegasusLite wrapped compute jobs, can directly pull the
data from the locations specified in the replica catalog.  This is based on
the assumption that the worker nodes can access the input site. However,
you should be aware that the access to the input site is no longer throttled
( as in case of stage in jobs). If large number of compute jobs start at
the same time in a workflow, the input server will see a connection
from each job.

To enable this you can either

* Set the property **pegasus.transfer.bypass.input.staging** to **true** to
  enable bypass of all input files.

OR

* You can associate the **bypass flag** at a per file(data file, executable or
  container) basis while constructing your workflow using the Python API.
  Below is a snippet of a generated abstract workflow that highlights bypass
  at a per file level:

Bypass in condorio mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case of **condorio** data configuration where condor file transfers are
used to transfer the input files directly from the locally accessible input
locations, you must ensure that file URL's with "*site*" attribute
set to local are specified in the replica catalog.

Pegasus use of HTCondor File Transfers does not allow for the destination file
to have a name that differs from the basename of the file url in the replica
catalog. As a result, if the lfn for the input file does not match the basename
of the file location specified in the Replica Catalog for that LFN, Pegasus
will automatically disable bypass for that file even if it is marked for bypass.
