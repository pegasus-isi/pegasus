Monitoring Database
===================

Pegasus launches a monitoring daemon called ``pegasus-monitord`` per
workflow (a single daemon is launched if a user submits a hierarchical
workflow). ``pegasus-monitord`` parses the workflow and job logs in the
submit directory and populates to a database. This section gives an
overview of the ``pegasus-monitord`` and describes the schema of the runtime
database.

.. _monitoring-pegasus-monitord:

pegasus-monitord
----------------

``pegasus-monitord`` is used to follow workflows, parsing the output of
DAGMan's ``dagman.out`` file. In addition to generating the ``jobstate.log``
file, which contains the various states that a job goes through during
the workflow execution, ``pegasus-monitord`` can also be used to mine
information from jobs' submit and output files, and either populate a
database, or write a file with NetLogger events containing this
information. ``pegasus-monitord`` can also send notifications to users
in real-time as it parses the workflow execution logs.

``pegasus-monitord`` is automatically invoked by ``pegasus-run``, and
tracks workflows in real-time. By default, it produces the ``jobstate.log``
file, and a SQLite database, which contains all the information listed
in the `Stampede schema <#stampede_schema_overview>`__. When a workflow
fails, and is re-submitted with a rescue DAG, ``pegasus-monitord`` will
automatically pick up from where it left previously and continue to
write the ``jobstate.log`` file and populate the database.

If, once the workflow has completed, users need to re-create the
``jobstate.log`` file, or re-populate the database from scratch,
``pegasus-monitord``'s ``--replay`` (or ``-r``) option should be used
when running it manually.

Populating to different backend databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to SQLite, ``pegasus-monitord`` supports other types of
databases, such as MySQL and Postgres. Users will need to install the
low-level database drivers, and can use the ``--dest`` command-line
option, or the ``pegasus.monitord.output`` property to select where the
logs should go.

As an example, the command:

::

   $ pegasus-monitord -r diamond-0.dag.dagman.out

will launch ``pegasus-monitord`` in replay mode. In this case, if a
``jobstate.log`` file already exists, it will be rotated and a new file will
be created. It will also create/use a SQLite database in the workflow's
run directory, with the name of ``diamond-0.stampede.db``. If the database
already exists, it will make sure to remove any references to the
current workflow before it populates the database. In this case,
``pegasus-monitord`` will process the workflow information from start to
finish, including any restarts that may have happened.

Users can specify an alternative database for the events, as illustrated
by the following examples:

::

   $ pegasus-monitord -r -d mysql://username:userpass@hostname/database_name diamond-0.dag.dagman.out

::

   $ pegasus-monitord -r -d sqlite:////tmp/diamond-0.db diamond-0.dag.dagman.out

In the first example, ``pegasus-monitord`` will send the data to the
``database_name`` database located at server ``hostname``, using the
``username`` and ``userpass`` provided. In the second example,
``pegasus-monitord`` will store the data in the ``/tmp/diamond-0.db``
SQLite database.

.. note::

   For absolute paths, four slashes are required when specifying an
   alternative database path in SQLite.

Users should also be aware that in all cases, with the exception of
SQLite, the database should exist before ``pegasus-monitord`` is run (as
it creates all needed tables but does not create the database itself).

Finally, the following example:

::

   $ pegasus-monitord -r --dest diamond-0.bp diamond-0.dag.dagman.out

sends events to the ``diamond-0.bp`` file. (please note that in replay mode,
any data on the file will be overwritten).

One important detail is that while processing a workflow,
``pegasus-monitord`` will automatically detect if/when sub-workflows are
initiated, and will automatically track those sub-workflows as well. In
this case, although ``pegasus-monitord`` will create a separate
``jobstate.log`` file in each workflow directory, the database at the
top-level workflow will contain the information from not only the main
workflow, but also from all sub-workflows.

.. _monitoring-files:

Monitoring related files in the workflow directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pegasus-monitord`` generates a number of files in each workflow
directory:

-  ``jobstate.log``: contains a summary of workflow and job execution.

-  ``monitord.log``: contains any log messages generated by
   ``pegasus-monitord``. It is not overwritten when it restarts. This
   file is not generated in replay mode, as all log messages from
   ``pegasus-monitord`` are output to the console. Also, when
   sub-workflows are involved, only the top-level workflow will have
   this log file.

-  ``monitord.started``: contains a timestamp indicating when
   ``pegasus-monitord`` was started. This file get overwritten every
   time ``pegasus-monitord`` starts.

-  ``monitord.done``: contains a timestamp indicating when
   ``pegasus-monitord`` finished. This file is overwritten every time
   ``pegasus-monitord`` starts.

-  ``monitord.info``: contains ``pegasus-monitord`` state information,
   which allows it to resume processing if a workflow does not finish
   properly and a rescue DAG is submitted. This file is erased when
   ``pegasus-monitord`` is executed in replay mode.

-  ``monitord.recover``: contains ``pegasus-monitord`` state information
   that allows it to detect that a previous instance of
   ``pegasus-monitord`` failed (or was killed) midway through parsing a
   workflow's execution logs. This file is only present while
   ``pegasus-monitord`` is running, as it is deleted when it ends and
   the **monitord.info** file is generated.

-  ``monitord.subwf.db``: contains information that aids
   ``pegasus-monitord`` to track when sub-workflows fail and are
   re-planned/re-tried. It is overwritten when ``pegasus-monitord`` is
   started in replay mode.

-  ``monitord-notifications.log``: contains the log file for
   notification-related messages. Normally, this file only includes logs
   for failed notifications, but can be populated with all notification
   information when ``pegasus-monitord`` is run in verbose mode via the
   ``-v`` command-line option.

Multiple End points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

```pegasus-monitord`` can be used to publish `events <#stampede_wf_events>`__
to different backends at the same time. The configuration of this is
managed through properties matching
``pegasus.catalog.workflow.<variable-name>.url``.

For example, to enable populating to an AMQP end point and a file format
in addition to default SQLite you can configure as follows:

::

   pegasus.catalog.workflow.amqp.url amqp://vahi:XXXXX@amqp.isi.edu:5672/panorama/monitoring
   pegasus.catalog.workflow.file.url file:///lfs1/work/monitord/amqp/nl.bp

If you want to only override the default SQLite population, then you
can specify the ``pegasus.catalog.workflow.url`` property.

.. _stampede-schema-overview:

Overview of the Workflow Database Schema.
-----------------------------------------

Pegasus takes in an abstract workflow, which is composed of tasks.
Pegasus plans it into a Condor DAG / Executable workflow that consists
of Jobs. In case of Clustering, multiple tasks in the DAX can be captured
into a single job in the Executable workflow. When DAGMan executes a job,
a job instance is populated. Job instances capture information as seen by
DAGMan. In case DAGMan retries a job when detecting a failure, a new job
instance is populated. When DAGMan finds a job instance has finished, an
invocation is associated with the job instance. In case of a clustered job,
multiple invocations will be associated with a single job instance. If a Pre
script or Post Script is associated with a job instance, then
invocations are populated in the database for the corresponding job
instance.

   Workflow Database Schema

.. _schema-upgrade-tool:

Storing of Exitcode in the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kickstart records capture raw status in addition to the exitcode. The
exitcode is derived from the raw status. Since Pegasus 4.0,
all exitcode columns (i.e., invocation and job instance table
columns) are stored with the raw status by ``pegasus-monitord``. If an
exitcode is encountered while parsing the dagman log files, the value
is converted to the corresponding raw status before it is stored. All
user tools, ``pegasus-analyzer`` and ``pegasus-statistics`` then convert
the raw status to ``exitcode`` when retrieving from the database.

Multiplier Factor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Pegasus 4.0, there is a multiplier factor associated with the
jobs in the ``job_instance`` table. It defaults to one, unless the
user associates a Pegasus profile key named ``cores`` with the job in
the abstract workflow. The factor can be used for getting more accurate
statistics for jobs that run on multiple processors/cores or mpi jobs.

The multiplier factor is used for computing the following metrics by
pegasus statistics:

-  In the summary, the workflow cumulative job wall time

-  In the summary, the cumulative job wall time as seen from the submit
   side.

-  In the jobs file, the multiplier factor is listed along-with the
   multiplied kickstart time.

-  In the breakdown file, where statistics are listed per transformation
   the mean, min, max, and average values take into account the
   multiplier factor.

.. _stampede-wf-events:

Stampede Workflow Events
========================

All the events generated by the system ( Pegasus planner and monitoring
daemon) are formatted as Netlogger BP events. The netlogger events that
Pegasus generates are described in Yang schema file that can be found in

Publishing to AMQP Message Servers
==================================

The\ `workflow events <#stampede_wf_events>`__ generated by
*pegasus-monitord*\ can also be used to publish to an AMQP message
server such as RabbitMQ in addition to the stampede workflow database.

.. note::

   A thing to keep in mind. The workflow events are documented as
   conforming to the netlogger requirements. When events are pushed to
   an AMQP endpoint, the . in the keys are replaced by \_ .

Configuration
-------------

In order to get *pegasus-monitord* to populate to a message queue, you
can set the following property

::

   pegasus.catalog.workflow.amqp.url amqp://[USERNAME:PASSWORD@]amqp.isi.edu[:port]/<exchange_name>

The routing key set for the messages matches the name of the stampede
workflow event being sent. By default, if you enable AMQP population
only the following events are sent to the server

-  stampede.job_inst.tag

-  stampede.inv.end

-  stampede.wf.plan

To configure additional events, you can specify a comma separated list
of events that need to be sent using the property
**pegasus.catalog.workflow.amqp.events**. For example

::

   pegasus.catalog.workflow.amqp.events = stampede.xwf.*,stampede.static.*

..

.. note::

   To get all events you can just specify \* as the value to the
   property.

Monitord, RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AMQP support in Monitord is still a work in progress, but even the
current functionality provides basic support for getting the monitoring
data into ElasticSearch. In our development environment, we use a
RabbitMQ instance with a simple exhange/queue. The configuration
required for Pegasus is:

::

   # help Pegasus developers collect data on integrity failures
   pegasus.monitord.encoding = json
   pegasus.catalog.workflow.amqp.url = amqp://friend:donatedata@msgs.pegasus.isi.edu:5672/prod/workflows


On the other side of the queue, Logstash is configured to receive the
messages and forward them to ElasticSearch. The Logstash pipeline looks
something like:

::

   input {
     rabbitmq {
       type => "workflow-events"
       host => "msg.pegasus.isi.edu"
       vhost => "prod"
       queue => "workflows-es"
       heartbeat => 30
       durable => true
       password => "XXXXXX"
       user => "prod-logstash"
     }
   }

   filter {
     if [type] == "workflow-events" {
       mutate {
         convert => {
           "dur" => "float"
           "remote_cpu_time" => "float"
         }
       }
       date {
         # set @timestamp from the ts of the actual event
         match => [ "ts", "UNIX" ]
       }
       date {
         match => [ "start_time", "UNIX" ]
         target => "start_time_human"
       }
       fingerprint {
         # create unique document ids
         source => "ts"
         concatenate_sources => true
         method => "SHA1"
         key => "Pegasus Event"
         target => "[@metadata][fingerprint]"
       }
     }
   }

   output {
     if [type] == "workflow-events" {
       elasticsearch {
         "hosts" => ["es1.isi.edu:9200", "es2.isi.edu:9200"]
         "sniffing" => false
         "document_type" => "workflow-events"
         "document_id" => "%{[@metadata][fingerprint]}"
         "index" => "workflow-events-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
         "template" => "/usr/share/logstash/templates/workflow-events.json"
         "template_name" => "workflow-events-*"
         "template_overwrite" => true
       }
     }

   }


Once the data is ElasticSearch, you can easily create for example

A Pre-Configured Data Collection Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this `repository <https://github.com/pegasus-isi/dibbs-data-collection-setup>`_,
we provide a containerized data-collection/visualization pipeline similar to
what we use in production. The figure below illustrates the processes involved
in the pipeline and how they are connected to one another. For more information
regarding setup and usage, please visit the link referenced above.
