=head1 NAME

GriPhyN::Pin - Perl extension for blah blah blah

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use GriPhyN::Pin;
  blah blah blah

=head1 ABSTRACT

  This should be the abstract for GriPhyN::Pin.
  The abstract is used when making PPD (Perl Package Description) files.
  If you don't want an ABSTRACT you should also edit Makefile.PL to
  remove the ABSTRACT_FROM option.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stub documentation for GriPhyN::Pin, created by h2xs. It looks like the
author of the extension was negligent enough to leave the stub
unedited.

Blah blah blah.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
