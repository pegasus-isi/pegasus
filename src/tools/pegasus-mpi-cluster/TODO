This is a list of items that are planned in future versions of mpidag.

* Add task runtime to rescue file?
* Allow tries to be specified with -t/--tries in DAG (e.g. TASK A -t 3 /bin/date)
* Add task runtimes in rescue file (e.g. DONE foo 10.0)?
* Enable weight in DAG with -w/--weight (e.g. TASK A -w 10 /bin/date)
* Enable -p/--priority as an alias for -w/--weight in DAG
* Add support for priority-based scheduling using weights
* Add BFS and DFS mode via level-based weights
* Add support for more sophisticated scheduling? (e.g. homogeneous task 
  scheduling like FCFS, EFT, ETF, HLFET, MCP, DCP, MD, and others described 
  in the DCP paper) Some algorithms could use the weight as a strict 
  priority, some could use the weight as a runtime estimate, and some could 
  use weight as a, well, weight.
